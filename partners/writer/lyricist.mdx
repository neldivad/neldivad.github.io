We're here to write lyrics. Traditionally it has always been me, but suppose you have a great story, or if we plan to do it in a different language (JP, KR, etc.), I could use your help. 

Whether its your first time, or you're already with us, just refer to this link to remember our workflow and practice.

# Original 

[chorus]
who's watching me?
每个脚步，我出人头地
is there anyone who could see me?
是星空闪耀的光
还是社会排斥的低沉的腐败垃圾？
```

```
# With backup 

[chorus]
who's watching me?
每个脚步，我出人头地
is there anyone who could see me? (anyone can see me? anyone?)
是星空闪耀的光
还是社会排斥的低沉的腐败垃圾？(腐败垃圾yeah)
```

We are artists working with trust, professionalism, and creative freedom. What we will be creating together is more than just our individual work. Here's the boring part, but you should still read it so we can get to the fun part.  

As a lyricist, you get exposed to the most raw content (my pre-master), so there is little risk. Just a refresher though. 

- **Do not redistribute project materials** (audio, art, drafts, exports) outside the team without permission.

**Don't get caught cheating**. 

Honestly, how do you even cheat at lyrics? AI-generates Neon, Eon, peon, rhymes with solo, shadow, tomorrow and borrow. 

You know its a cliche.

## Input 
AKA what you should get from us. It is encouraged that you don't rush yourself until you have all of this.

### Song Draft
- instrumental 
- vocal melody guide if available

---

## Output 
AKA what we get from you

### Full Lyrics
- Labeled by section (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.)
- Format: TXT or Google Doc
- If multilingual: Romanized + translated version (not required for EN, CN)
- Timestamp not required unless you have SynthV / Vocaloid
- Space breaks to show the transition of lyrics

Example: 
```
# Good
[verse-2] (rap) 
谁定规章 和设路障 却比技人 拿得更多？ 
而高管亏了钱 却还发奖金 是怎么说？ 

## spacing follows melody syncopation
```

```
# Not good
[verse-2] (rap) 
谁定规章和设路障? 却比技人拿得更多？
而高管亏了钱却还发奖金! 是怎么说？ 

## no spacing, punctuation follows common language syntax, and not musical syncopation
```

## Workflow

### Pre-production
- Review instrumental concept (BPM, arrangement)
- Select theme (e.g., love, death, etc.)
- Confirm lyrical language(s) and intended tone  
- If you have SynthV / Vocaloid, just throwing words at it will eventually work. 

### Writing
- Just keep writing until it rhymes. 
- Words is very fluid. There is a lot of ways to pronounce a word. You can replace and mix language too. 
- Revision. Usually, I'll just take over the lyrics and rewrite it while listening to the vocaloid simulation a second time. And everyone takes turns until everyone is happy. 
- Remember to keep simulating the vocaloid and try singing it yourself! (Some lyrics makes sense, but contain a lot of `s` and `z` in a short time that no one can sing!)

### Handoff
- Ensure format compatibility for storyboard artist and subtitle work  
- Deliver via shared folder or collaboration doc  
- You get credited as lyricist in all video formats and descriptions


:::success Producer's message
You write first. Everyone else follows your rhythm.

The storyboard needs your words to build visuals. The editor needs your lyrics to time the cut. The vocal needs your words without biting their tongue off.

Here's a good priority to decide how hard you want to work.

1. Honor your artistic vision first
2. Make sure you have enough time / money to finish the job

...

99. Try too hard to be perfect
