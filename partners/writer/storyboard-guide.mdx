We're here to make MV. Traditionally, this role is either done by me,  illustrator, video editor. 

If you are either of them and you are checking out this page, it means you have more chances to draw what you want and get to be part of the decision maker. 

Whether its your first time, or you're already with us, just refer to this link to remember our workflow and practice.

```
song → lyricist → storyboard → illustrator → video editor
```

## Requirements
### Personal details
- Not necessary for your `Name, Age, Gender, Race, Religion, Nationality.` Personal life details are not required. We're focused on your pen.
- Stagename, social handles  
- Budget, ask price
- Prefer to be good at understanding language context, and have drawing experience to come up with good "camera angles"

### Software
- Any text editor is fine, but it's good to deliver with:
  - Google Docs (for collaboration/comments) [^1]
  - TXT (I have a strong preference for Markdown syntax because I can wrap more context, and its secretly OP with AI parsing)

[^1]: I'm a madman who uses VSCode for lyrics

:::info Respect IP and copyrights

We are artists working with trust, professionalism, and creative freedom. What we will be creating together is more than just our individual work. Here's the boring part, but you should still read it so we can get to the fun part.  

As a storyboard writer, you get exposed to just my pre-master and lyrics, so there is little risk. Just a refresher though. 

- **Do not redistribute project materials** (audio, art, drafts, exports) outside the team without permission.

## Input 
AKA what you should get from us. It is encouraged that you don't rush yourself until you have all of this.

### Song Draft
- voiced, premaster recording
- Timestamped lyrics

Example: 
```
[Verse 1]
0:21.21
清晨的风 轻拂着窗台

0:23.94
我梦见你 在门前徘徊

我记得小时候 跟你学菜肴

0:28.64
我在厨房烟火一通胡闹
```

## Output 
AKA what we get from you

### Scenes breakdown
- Timecode range (e.g. 0:00–0:15)
- Audio cue or lyric reference
- Description of visual (e.g. camera pan, fade, focus, emotion)
- Illustration reference (optional)
- Decide on how many scenes you want to have (within my budget please)

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>
Scene 1:

Lyrics: 
```
0:00–0:30

Like a ghost, with no face, that comes after me
Does it consume me? Whatever.
In this world, I'm stretched thin  
Fall in to decay
```

Description:

1-3 word describing each features of the scene. Ideally its something you can later just drop into civitai [^2] and get some camera shots. 

[^2]: For AI haters, I'll just admit and say that its actually a waste of time if you knew 20% of what you want. Maybe that helps you feel better.
```
Focus person, abstract crowd background. Theme, ignorance, apathy, invisible to the crowd.

## Workflow
### Pre-production 
- Read through lyrics and keep listening to the song.
- Note key emotional shifts, tempo changes, or lyric emphasis
- Talk with lyricist or producer for intent and meaning. Just interview the writer and have conversations about the song!

### Drafting the Storyboard
- Block out time segments first (e.g. Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.)
- Write down the feel/mood and decide the POV, subject, BG
- Draw your own sketch (ugly but can be understood)
- Add suggested transitions or animation behavior for each scene
- Decide if it's going to be `Comic style`, `Animated Sticker style`, `Detailed illustration style`.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

**Comic style:**
- [Dareharu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnLdwkh4rjw&ab_channel=dareharu%EB%8B%AC%EC%9D%98%ED%95%98%EB%A3%A8)

**Animated Sticker style:** 
- [nanawoakari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-MVk5I6wjo)

**Detailed illustration style:**
- [Hamelin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvY2OuCcrI8&ab_channel=Hamelin_%E5%93%88%E7%B1%B3%E4%BC%A6%E7%9A%84%E5%BC%84%E7%AC%9B%E8%80%85)

</details>


### Feedback and Iteration
- Submit your storyboard draft to the producer and lyricist
- Revise once or twice depending on review comments
- Ask if illustrator can even draw something like that, and if producer can even afford something like that! (💀 An architect's dream is an engineer's nightmare)

## Handoff
- List of scenes / camera angles 
- Number of sprites / stickers you want to make. Number of expression covered.
- Suggest scenes / sprite on audio timing, runtime. (See [scenes breakdown](#scenes-breakdown))

:::success Producer's note
Just scribble on the page. Don't worry about the quality. 

We just want to decide on the scenes and camera angle. Your main objective is to save everyone's time and money. 

> Well... usually we just take turns doing this part...
