We are artists working with trust, professionalism, and creative freedom. What we will be creating together is more than just our individual work. Here's the boring part, but you should still read it so we can get to the fun part.  

In most cases, I trust we are all nice people and we want to do the right thing. Just in case you have doubts with your accountability, here's the TL;DR:

- **Do not redistribute project materials** (audio, art, drafts, exports) outside the team without permission.
- **Finished work belongs to the producer unless otherwise negotiated**. Editors and artists can post snippets for portfolio after release with proper credits.
- **Credit where it's due**. Everyone's name should appear where relevant (in YouTube description, end credits, etc).

Finally, 

**Don't get caught cheating**. 

*This is not a permission or signal from me that cheating is OK*. I get that artists break rules all the time and who I am to stop anyone. I won't list examples so no one gets any ideas, but I am aware of some tricks. If you are unsure, ask first. 

The important thing is now that you are not working alone, everyone will be accountable for each other's mistakes too so please be considerate.

## Output Deliverables
Each item is **charged separately**. We don't expect you to do everything here unless the budget allows. Be transparent about what you can or cannot deliver.

I don't have infinite money, you don't have infinite time, and **its better to be done than to be perfect**. Let us agree on the standards before we start. 

### Illustrations
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080px  
  (Specific aspect ratios: 16:9, 1:1, or 9:16 depending on scene layout)
- **File Format**: PNG or PSD (layered if for motion)
- **Purpose**: Static character or background assets for animation or compositing
- **Notes**: Include layers for parallax or subtle movement (e.g., hair, eyes, sky) (if animation is in package)


### Manga Panels
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080px  
  (Specific aspect ratios: 16:9, 1:1, or 9:16 depending on scene layout)
- **File Format**: PNG or PSD
- **Purpose**: Used for manga-style scenes
- **Notes**: No captions unless requested, minimal background preferred.

### Coloring (Optional)
- Unless specified, start from `sketch` >> `line` >> `BW` >> `grayscale` >> `color`


### Animation / Live2D (Optional)
- **Format**: Transparent PNG sequence, GIF, or Live2D export (MOV/APNG)
- **Purpose**: Additional effects (e.g., eye blink, mouth open, hair sway) for cut-ins or chorus visuals
- **Scope**: Discuss complexity beforehand (usually a few frames is enough)
- **Notes**: Requires layered PSD. Please specify whether this is motion-only (AE) or rig-based (Live2D Cubism).

### Your handle signature (Optional)
- We use it to watermark your work
- We will use it to credit you in the final video

## Workflow 
### Pre-production 
- Review song lyrics and moodboard or scene breakdown (if available)
- Confirm art responsibilities: character, background, manga panels, or animation-ready layers
- Align on style references (from provided videos, manga, or visual sheets)
- Submit quote and payment terms
- Agree on delivery deadline and revision rounds
- Provide initial sketch or composition thumbnails for each scene or illustration
- Receive 50% deposit after confirmation of story direction 

### Production
- Proceed to final line art and base color
- Submit WIP screenshots or timelapse at 25%, 50% and 90% progress (to minimize revision)
- Request feedback before proceeding to shading, effects, and final polish
- Submit first draft to GDrive for full review by producer at 100% work. Revision counters starts now. 
- Producer will review draft, submit comments at timing, and resubmit draft for 2nd revision. 
- Ideally, no more than 2 revisions in total (to respect illustrator's time).

### Post-production
- Submit final illustrations in agreed resolution and format (PNG or PSD)
- Include clearly labeled layers if animation is expected (e.g., "hair", "eyes", "background")
- Compress and upload files via GDrive, Dropbox
- Confirm artist credit details for MV rollout (YouTube name, IG handle, etc.)


:::success Producer's message
There are no rules, but here's a good priority to decide how hard you want to work. 
1. Honor your artistic vision first
2. Make sure you have enough time / money to finish the job

99. Better be done than be perfect
