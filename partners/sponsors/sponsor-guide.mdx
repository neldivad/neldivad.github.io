:::success Umm, hi

You probably didn't come here looking to sponsor someone. But you might stick around if this turns out to be a great story to support.

## What I do
I'm David Len, I'm a vocaloid producer for Synth-V. My vision is to create musical novels with a good story. 

Before my vision, I think its more important I create commercial viability for creators. 

I want to advance the art scene in SEA, and hence my recent aggression in partnering with SEA artists. I believe the best way to motivate artists is to pay them enough money to work with you and I will do the honors of being the early guy.

## Why your help matters 
Obviously, I'll be broke one day if I don't sell well. 

Let's see what my life is going to be depending on the reception I get with sponsors and donors. 

💀 **Bad Ending**: 

I burn out. Artists who used to work with me get some clout, and then they will have to go their own way. Maybe I'll start a dumb podcast. No... I actually need to get a new job. 

😐 **Okay Ending**: 

We make a few good things. I find my tribe. Everyone gets a level-up.  


🏆 **Good Ending**: 

I make new MVs every month. Streams pays me enough to finance everyone. SEA talent gets paid. I stay relevant for 10 years.

## What's in it for you? 
### 🎨 **Creators**  
No money needed — just attention, time, and your best work.  
I'll make your commissions worth more, build better networks, and help create something people *want* to see.

> I don't always have to be the guy who hires other creators. If you have something you want to do you can also hire me to write a song for you.

### 🎨 **Performers**
I'm just a programmer / orchestrator who rarely shows up on public. I don't have a lot of swag and I get stage frights.

If one of my songs is something you sing in a shower all day or you're jamming to impress your girl, you should totally do a cover of it. 

Check out the "Performer" tab and see if there is a role for you. I might even find plans for you. 

### 🏢 **Advertisers / Brands**  
I make music videos that don't feel like ads.  
Cool enough for gamers, but I'll even make lawyers look hype. You’d be surprised.

### 💸 **Donors / Supporters**  
This is where I finally get to take someone's money for free. 

Nah, you should get something for yourself too. Maybe you already like our work and and you think supporting us is enough for you. It's going to be more worthwhile than that.

I'll find a way to make you look cooler than everyone else — just keep your receipt. (Early backers get better perks.)

### 👨‍💻 **Producers / Developers / Nerds**  
I speak your language. I'm a tech guy.  

Let me use your tools, show up in your podcast, promote your startup whatever. 

No crypto.
