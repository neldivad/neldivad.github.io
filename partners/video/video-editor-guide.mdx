We are artists working with trust, professionalism, and creative freedom. What we will be creating together is more than just our individual work. Here's the boring part, but you should still read it so we can get to the fun part.  

In most cases, I trust we are all nice people and we want to do the right thing. Just in case you have doubts with your accountability, here's the TL;DR:

- **Do not redistribute project materials** (audio, art, drafts, exports) outside the team without permission.
- **Finished work belongs to the producer unless otherwise negotiated**. Editors and artists can post snippets for portfolio after release with proper credits.
- **Credit where it's due**. Everyone's name should appear where relevant (in YouTube description, end credits, etc).

Finally, 

**Don't get caught cheating**. 

*This is not a permission or signal from me that cheating is OK*. I get that artists break rules all the time and who I am to stop anyone. I won't list examples so no one gets any ideas, but I am aware of some tricks. If you are unsure, ask first. 

The important thing is now that you are not working alone, everyone will be accountable for each other's mistakes too so please be considerate.

## Workflow
### Pre-production 
- Check [input](#input) and ensure all assets are in place 
- I should have paid you 50% deposit.
- Align and agreed on reference MMV style
- Set up delivery timeline / deadline

### Editing 
- Screenshot sample of MMV frames at 25%, 50% of work for review to avoid mistakes / minimize revisions. 
- Submit first draft to GDrive for full review by producer at 100% work. **Revision counters starts now.** 
- Producer will review draft, submit comments at timing, and resubmit draft for 2nd revision. 
- Ideally, no more than 2 revisions in total (to respect editor's time).

### Post-production
- Export 16:9 final cut 
- Duplicate video for 1:1 and 9:16 edits at highlighted timing. Remember to use Fade-in / fade-out transitions (to not frighten viewers) 
- Export all three formats

:::success Producer's message
There are no rules, but here's a good priority to decide how hard you want to work. 
1. Honor your artistic vision first
2. Make sure you have enough time / money to finish the job
