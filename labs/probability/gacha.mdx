This comprehensive suite of interactive calculators helps you understand gacha systems and general gacha mechanics analysis.

:::info Understanding the Pity System

The gacha system features a "soft pity" mechanism where drop rates increase significantly after certain thresholds, and a hard pity that guarantees a limited drop at threshold.

Using Genshin Impact as an example:

- **Elite Characters**: Base rate 0.5%, soft pity starts at 75 draws, hard pity at 90 draws
- **Elite Weapons**: Base rate 0.5%, soft pity starts at 65 draws, hard pity at 80 draws
- **50/50**: Meaning there is a 50% chance to get the event limited character.

The example parameters you will select for Genshin Impact will be: 
- Pity Peak: 90
- Pity Start: 75
- Bernuolli Probability: 50

Different games have different rates, example Bernuolli rate of 75/25 for HSR lightcones, or 100/0 for Wuthering Wave's weapon.

## Cumulative Probability Chart

This chart shows how many attempts you need to reach specific probability thresholds for obtaining target copies.

:::info

Suppose you intend to C6 a limited character from Genshin Impact, you will read the green line "Bernuolli + Pity adjust". 

At default settings, it works out to ~1300 rolling attempts to have a 95% chance of maxing out your character.
