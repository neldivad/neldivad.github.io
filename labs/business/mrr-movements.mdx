# MRR Movement Analysis

Understanding **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) movements** is crucial for SaaS businesses. This interactive tool demonstrates how different business parameters affect your revenue growth and churn patterns.

<details>
   <summary>Why MRR Movements Matter</summary>

   **The Problem with High Churn**
   - High cancellation rates (5-7% monthly) create a ceiling on growth
   - Even with strong new customer acquisition, churn eventually wins
   - Marketing and sales don't scale automatically with company size
   - At 5% monthly churn, growth tops out quickly

   **Real-World Example: Buffer**
   - Started with linear growth (2012-2014)
   - Reduced churn to 5%/month, enabling faster growth (2014-2020)
   - But 5% churn was still too high - growth leveled off in 2020
   - Never recovered to previous growth rates

   **The Math**
   - 5% monthly churn = 60% annual churn
   - You need to acquire 60%+ new customers annually just to stay flat
   - This becomes increasingly difficult as you scale

   <summary>Understanding MRR Components</summary>

   **Positive MRR Movements (Growth)**
   - **New MRR**: Revenue from new customers
   - **Expansion MRR**: Existing customers upgrading plans
   - **Reactivation MRR**: Churned customers returning

   **Negative MRR Movements (Loss)**
   - **Churned MRR**: Revenue lost from customers leaving
   - **Contraction MRR**: Revenue lost from customers downgrading

   **Key Insight**
   - Net MRR = Positive movements - Negative movements
   - Sustainable growth requires positive net MRR
   - High churn makes this nearly impossible to maintain

   <summary>Key Metrics Explained</summary>

   **Core Parameters**
   - **Customers**: Total paying customers
   - **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User (monthly)
   - **LTV**: Lifetime Value of a customer
   - **Churn Rate**: Monthly percentage of customers who cancel
   - **MAU**: Monthly Active Users (total)
   - **PMAU**: Paid Monthly Active Users
   - **FMAU**: Free Monthly Active Users

   **Derived Metrics**
   - **MRR**: Monthly Recurring Revenue (Customers × ARPU)
   - **ARR**: Annual Recurring Revenue (MRR × 12)
   - **Conversion Rate**: PMAU / MAU
   - **Calculated LTV**: ARPU / Churn Rate

   **The Churn Problem**
   - Calculated LTV = ARPU / Churn Rate
   - At 5% monthly churn: LTV = ARPU / 0.05 = 20 × ARPU
   - At 2% monthly churn: LTV = ARPU / 0.02 = 50 × ARPU
   - Lower churn dramatically improves LTV

   <summary>How to Use This Tool</summary>

   **Start with Realistic Parameters**
   - Set your current customer count and ARPU
   - Input your actual churn rate (be honest!)
   - Adjust MAU, PMAU, and FMAU to match your funnel

   **Experiment with Churn Rates**
   - Try 5% monthly churn (common but problematic)
   - Compare with 2% monthly churn (much healthier)
   - See how dramatically this affects growth potential

   **Key Observations**
   - **High churn (5%+)**: Growth plateaus quickly
   - **Medium churn (2-3%)**: Sustainable growth possible
   - **Low churn (1-2%)**: Strong growth potential
   - **Very low churn (1%)**: Exponential growth possible

   **The Buffer Pattern**
   - Notice how growth curves flatten with high churn
   - Even with consistent new customer acquisition
   - Churn eventually dominates the equation
   - This is why product-market fit is crucial

   <summary>Actionable Insights</summary>

   **If You Have High Churn (3% monthly)**
   1. **Stop focusing on acquisition** - fix retention first
   2. **Survey churned customers** - understand why they leave
   3. **Improve onboarding** - reduce early churn
   4. **Add value faster** - customers need to see ROI quickly
   5. **Consider pricing changes** - sometimes higher prices = better fit

   **If You Have Low Churn (2% monthly)**
   1. **Double down on acquisition** - you have product-market fit
   2. **Invest in expansion** - existing customers are happy
   3. **Scale marketing** - your unit economics work
   4. **Consider premium tiers** - customers will pay for more value

   **The Golden Rule**
   - **Churn rate determines your growth ceiling**
   - **Product-market fit = low churn**
   - **No amount of marketing can overcome poor retention**
   - **Focus on churn before scaling acquisition**

   <summary>Real-World Benchmarks</summary>

   **Excellent SaaS Metrics**
   - Monthly churn: 2%
   - Annual churn: 20%
   - LTV/CAC ratio: 3:1
   - Payback period: 12 months

   **Average SaaS Metrics**
   - Monthly churn: 3-5%
   - Annual churn: 30-50%
   - LTV/CAC ratio: 2-3:1
   - Payback period: 12-18 months

   **Poor SaaS Metrics**
   - Monthly churn: 5%
   - Annual churn: 50%
   - LTV/CAC ratio: 2:1
   - Payback period: 18 months

   **The Reality Check**
   - Most SaaS companies have poor metrics
   - This is why most fail to scale
   - Good metrics are rare but achievable
   - Focus on retention over acquisition
