# MRR Movement Analysis

Understanding **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) movements** is crucial for SaaS businesses. This interactive tool demonstrates how different business parameters affect your revenue growth and churn patterns.

<details>
   <summary>Why MRR Movements Matter</summary>

   **Growth is intuitive. Churn is not**
   - At churn = growth, business will stagnate.
   - At 5% monthly churn, growth peaks within 2 years
   - At 7% monthly churn, growth peaks within 1 year
   
   **The Math**
   - 5% monthly churn = 60% annual churn
   - You need to acquire 60%+ new customers annually just to stay flat
   - This becomes increasingly difficult as you scale

   <summary>Understanding MRR Components</summary>

   **Positive MRR Movements (Growth)**
   - **New MRR**: Revenue from new customers
   - **Expansion MRR**: Existing customers upgrading plans
   - **Reactivation MRR**: Churned customers returning

   **Negative MRR Movements (Loss)**
   - **Churned MRR**: Revenue lost from customers leaving
   - **Contraction MRR**: Revenue lost from customers downgrading

   **Summary**
   - Net MRR = Positive movements - Negative movements
   - Sustainable growth requires positive net MRR
   - Churn is usually the first and most impactful thing to work on for long-term growth.

   <summary>Key Metrics</summary>

   **Core Parameters**
   - **Users**: Total users (paid + free)
   - **Monthly growth**: Monthly percentage of new users
   - **Monthly churn**: Monthly percentage of users who cancel
   - **Growth, churn volatility**: Standard deviation for growth, churn rates (multiplicative)

   **Derived Metrics**
   - **MRR**: Monthly Recurring Revenue (Users × ARPU)
   - **ARR**: Annual Recurring Revenue (MRR × 12)
   - **Customer longevity (months)**: 100 / churn rate (monthly)
   - **LTV**: ARPU (monthly) / customer longevity (monthly)

   **Examples**
   - At 5% monthly churn: LTV = ARPU / 0.05 = 20 × ARPU
   - At 2% monthly churn: LTV = ARPU / 0.02 = 50 × ARPU
   - Lower churn improves LTV as it means your users stay subbed longer.
