Or, it's a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  The problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn't clear if the rich was actually the problem.  In the French Revolution, it's not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It's more like the top 1% against the top 0.1%. Most of the common people don't even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  Put simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it's in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.  How then should one find the dishonest actor that explains all of the present problems and injustice without resorting to sloppy reasoning that matches what the mainstream wants you to antagonize?    ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Discovering the anatomy of the heist​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to steal from the young without public attention","url":"/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-young#discovering-the-anatomy-of-the-heist","content":" Most understand that problems and inefficiency don't come out of nowhere, therefore something/someone must be responsible. The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is deliberate or accidental.  Many things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  Example: the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford tertiary education to gain the cultural capital required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  If you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees/license to bypass these regulations are the root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind, but you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  In fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  On a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China's gaokao. The same system that is the most unfair and repressive to lower class also happened to get the most support and defense from the lower class.  Gaokao creates &quot;unequal&quot; outcomes and &quot;widening social class,&quot; in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people &quot;accidentally&quot; creating social division.  In effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the candidate of &quot;opportunity stealing hero that escaped public scrutiny&quot; (OSHTEPS).  If you are convinced that China's gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you'll also find that most state's public education don't do better.  In US, public schools spend $20k per student for the results of 13% illiteracy rate. Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  If the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  Yet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSHTEPS.  With 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  Must have a way to avoid competition, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.Decisions are undemocratic (regulations setup by &quot;think tanks&quot; and &quot;experts&quot;)Victims having &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; to net negative practices. (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)  With such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.  If you enjoy where your logic will take you, stop scrolling and start thinking and see if your answers match with mine later.  I will do the honors and take the risk of exposing institutions with questionable motive and outcomes.  Here goes.

Undemocratic: HR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  Example, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn't problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.  Education degrees can function as a competency signal in certain industry, notably those in STEM. However, we seen HR discriminate non-degree applications regardless of the job function.  It doesn't help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world. Degrees now function more like a &quot;license to work&quot; that gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.  HR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects.
