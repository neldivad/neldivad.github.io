But one of the most pervasive forms of consumption masquerading as production today is the consumption of information.  In the digital age, access to vast amounts of information has never been easier. We subscribe to newsletters, follow thought leaders, and engage in market research, often under the pretense of staying informed and making better decisions.  However, literacy is no longer a problem today, rather its the distractions that is caused by generated noises.  The reality is that much of the information we consume today does not translate into tangible productive outcomes. Instead, it often serves as a form of cultural capital, providing a sense of being &quot;in the know&quot; without yielding real value.  How many of our LinkedIn doomscrolls translate into tangible career outcomes?  How many of the news on Twitter written by &quot;shiptalkers&quot; ends up helping us make better crafts?  How many equity research we read on SeekingAlpha, Substacks, and Medium translate into tangible trading signals?  The world is full of informed people that can't produce great crafts. We have too many people falling for the green-lumber fallacy.  This is not to say that information is not valuable, but when it becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end, it is consumption.  As a rule of thumb, if what you read ends up making &quot;someone else richer&quot; instead of &quot;you getting richer&quot;, it is consumption.  The time spent consuming information could often be better spent on actual productive activity, such as doing hobbies, building relationships, friendships -- outcomes that typically emerge from &quot;consumption leisure time&quot;.

Education is often seen as a productive pursuit, as it equips individuals with skills and knowledge that can enhance their productivity. This is mostly true only for STEM fields.  Even then many STEM jobs can still be taught to any curious mind and not exclusively reserved for those with expensive degrees.  But as many people would have observed when attending colleges, the motivations behind pursuing higher education are not always altruistic or productive. In many cases, the drive to acquire degrees and certifications is driven by credentialism -- the demand for certified skills.  Credentialism is a form of consumption, as it mandates a BS requirement that results in misaligned priority -- where the destructive motivation to acquire credentials hijacks the productive motivation to acquire useful skills or knowledge.  Individuals who pursue education solely for the sake of credentials are not producing -- they are submitting to an irrational demand for certification.  This phenomenon not only distorts the purpose of education but also creates a mismatch between the skills individuals possess and the skills the market truly needs.  We are also discounting the problem where going to college &quot;crowds-out&quot; a person from participating 4 years of productive labor and being exposed to the competitiveness of market.

From my observation as well as many people's testimony, in many organizations the primary focus of work is less about production but rather compliance.  Many employees are hired not to do work, but to make someone else feel more powerful.  On the first glance it is not that straightforward, as no one will admit this is the case. But looking at the quantitative results, earnings, and profitability, it immediately exposes the true motivations of some people. 1  Employees are expected to adhere to management structures, follow protocols, meet regulatory requirements. The most obvious examples being showing up to office 9-to-6, attending unnecessary meetings, requiring medical certification for absenteeism, and so on.  I understand for many businesses, compliance is a necessary evil to preserve discipline and decorum. A business or team that lacks discipline is a slippery slope that quickly cascades to failure. 2 3  While the origins of most protocols are well-intentioned, often they become bureaucratic exercises that consume time and resources without necessarily leading to more production -- more workers are hired (&quot;productive&quot;) because more time of veterans has been spent on compliance (&quot;consumption&quot;).  The economist's question is: &quot;Before implementing any protocols, is all of the demand of compliance worth the cost?&quot;  For most bureaucracies, they are not financially constrained to contemplate if hiring for compliances counts as wastage, especially if the institution is financed through public investment and public debt.  Many of them justify spending those cash on hiring people for compliances for a subset to feel more in control, often at the expense of shareholder's returns on equity or future taxpayers. 4 5  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Artistic perfectionism​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Illusion of productivity","url":"/blog/2025/03/01/illusion-of-productivity#artistic-perfectionism","content":" Art, in its essence, is an act of creation -- a process that brings ideas to life and provides value to both the creator and the audience.  However, perfectionism is an act of consumption masquerade as productivity, as it hinders the creation of value by postponing work, and often benefits no one except to feed the irrational ego of the artist.  It is difficult to draw a line between a productive desire (having high standards and to avoid redundant work later) and a consumption desire (to postpone shipping quality work to satisfy ego) since they both come from similar drive of &quot;wanting to achieve more&quot;.  It is important to recognize when this drive becomes excessive -- where there is an endless cycle of refinement, spending over budget to tweak details that are imperceptible to others.  At the heart of artistic perfectionism is often the fear of not being good enough. This fear can manifest as an intense need for control and perfection, driving the artist to overwork their craft.  While a certain level of ambition is healthy, when it becomes an obsession, any more &quot;production&quot; is quickly &quot;consumed&quot; by the ego -- no amount of productivity gains will result in growth if its all destroyed by the ego.

Entrepreneurship and deregulation has a positive externality to the market that is unrecognized and undervalued in the sense that it creates opportunity for other people to create value.  However, when opportunities are provided based on factors other than merit and wise risk-taking activity 6, they can become a form of consumption rather than production.  Consider hiring quotas, DEI, and other forms of &quot;opportunity supply&quot; that appeals to identity (although anything that is non-merit-based would result in destructive outcomes).  A naive person would think that these are a form of production, as they provide opportunities to people who would otherwise not get it under normal competitive scenarios. However, this deception can only fool those who cannot understand 2nd-order effects from such policies.  For anyone who understands 2nd-order effects, every non-merit-based opportunity supplied consumes the opportunity that would have otherwise been given to a more competitive person.  To measure the outcome of &quot;who is the net consumer of opportunities&quot;, we can look at the &quot;net opportunity created&quot; by a non-merit person relative to a merit person.  One might argue that an incompetent hire creates &quot;more opportunities&quot; as the problems and drama that come out of them means there is a demand for more people to come in and solve, whereas a competent hire does too much with too little, resulting in &quot;creative destruction&quot;. Under &quot;net employment&quot; metrics this will be true.  However, a person that creates drama for other people to cleanup means other people have less time for other productive pursuits. A person that does &quot;creative destruction&quot; means other people are liberated from monotonous tasks to pursue more challenging tasks. Numbers cannot decide who is a net producer or consumer of opportunities, but qualitatively we all can decide which one is more preferable.  &quot;Got it, lets do merit-based by looking at resumes and credentials!&quot;  If credentials are a signal to competence, then I'm sure many people wouldn't have any disagreements. That said, from our previous session and from this article, I have expressed low confidence to those signals as they had suffered from Goodhart's Law and perverse incentives by the recruiting industry.

Under basic rules of financial markets, the most worthy business to obtain capital should be the one that creates the greatest shareholder return, IE: the highest ROI, ROC, ROE, or ROA. The rationale being that the generated value will be returned to shareholders as dividends, and investors will use those dividends to pursue more productive market opportunities.  However, due to the considerations of positive and negative externalities (eg: dirty mining companies, labor exploitative companies taking too much public capital), ESG investments are created to redirect capital to businesses with expectation that those business generate enough positive externaties to lift the rest of the market.  That said, we have given ESG investments enough time and the results haven't been promising. From valuation and profitability standpoint, many companies from ESG portfolios underperformed the general market (less profitable, higher price/earnings, lower yields).  Even the label &quot;ESG&quot; is not a reliable signal to measure the quality of a company pursuing socially beneficial goals. XOM -- an oil and gas company has a better CDP score than TSLA -- an electric car and robotics company.  The classification of what constitutes an ESG company is opaque, undemocratic, and seems to correlated with financial spending on ESG consultants and compliance.  Many companies that try to get an ESG certification do so not for the benefit of consumers, or even for the benefit of shareholders 7. Rather, its to conform to the &quot;consumption of credentials&quot; highlighted earlier.

However, much of the trading that occurs in financial markets is actually a form of consumption.  Retail investors and traders frequently buy and sell assets without a clear rationale, often driven by emotions, speculation, or simply the desire to participate in the market.  If these activities do not yield better returns on a market-risk-adjusted basis, arguably they are simply consuming liquidity.  Financial advisors often warn against frequent trading for this reason, yet many trading platforms and market makers encourage it, as they have a vested interest in selling liquidity.

An employee that frequently looks for new jobs, changes jobs -- can be considered a productive activity if they are actively discovering information that helps their career progression that subsequently returns more value downstream from their new role.  However, the act of scouting also crowds out the productive activity of working hard and staying committed to the company. In effect, the relentless scouting consumes liquidity from the labor market by flooding recruiters with more data points to compete for a limited role.  Likewise, the same effect can be observed by recruiters who are constantly looking for new hires instead of creating incentives for existing employees to stay or be promoted.  A labor market with high turnover means lots of transaction costs involved, not to mention the cost of retraining new hires and the loss of productive momentum.  When you observe the market having a trend of greater spending in recruitment, shallow thinkers will mistakenly believe that the labor market is growing and subsequently a signal of a more productive economy.  Those who contemplate will realize it is the result of more liquidity consumers as a response to an increasingly inefficient market 8.

More people trying to meet this demand can be considered &quot;productive&quot; if they end up raising their own value in earnings, reputation, and social capital for their partners.  In practice, this is not what we observe. The explosion of choices means people are less commited, more choices, and subsequently more &quot;liquidity consumers&quot;.

If it has a dumb requirement, it is probably a consumption.  No amount of increased productivity will satisfy a dumb requirement, and the result will still be a stagnation of progress.    In effect, doing the wrong thing is no better than not producing anything.      Footnotes​ Pardon the sensitive example. It's like Hitler saying he is there to &quot;win the war&quot;, but careful inspection will see that he is distracted by many campaigns of ethnic cleansing -- an irrationality not shared by leaders who are actually trying to win the war. ↩ Despite me practicing WFH most of my time, I would prefer not to if I can work with driven and competent people as the best creative work results from physical proximity. More importantly, juniors don't get left behind and actually stand a chance to learn and be promoted. WFH is very destructive for social mobility and I only anecdotally see it working for the privileged and driven, which I am very fortunate to be part of. ↩ I expect pushback from WFH advocates after all I said about dumb requirements. For work that is critical, physical proximity is essential. Most work are not critical, so WFH is still a net positive relative to showing up on office to satisfy a manager's desire for control. ↩ Some bureaucracy's consumption for compliance has grown so serious to the point it has directly caused the collapse of birthrates, as many people are forced to be employed in BS roles and crowded out the time they could have spent on raising families. ↩ Basic intuition will refute that its the lack of money that is the core issue of declining birthrates. If the whole population is employed to upkeep a BS consumption (bureaucratic compliance), then all the salaries paid will still not afford a basic life as the cost of living will rise as fast as salaries getting paid. The net effect is shifting all the population's time from growing families to pushing papers in an office. We observe this happening in SK and JP, where employees make a lot of money by global standards but are not able to afford a basic life. ↩ A &quot;wise&quot; risk-taking action is when there is an asymmetrical upside relative to downside and does not outsource risk to the public. &quot;Opportunities&quot; financed by public-debt is not &quot;wise&quot; because it offloads downsides to the public. It is more correct to describe those debt-financed &quot;opportunities&quot; to be a consumption goods bought by &quot;future taxpayers&quot; -- depending on the outcome of those programs -- a positive ROI (scholarship) or a net value destruction (hiring mascots to meet quotas). ↩ If ESG really does benefit shareholders, the company would be more profitable, result in better valuation or growth after the certification. Instead, many of the returns generated post-certification are &quot;circular&quot; (IE: more capital raised from ESG funds that result in more expensive valuation but not profitability), or the &quot;profitability&quot; are revenue derived from government subsidy programs that taxes future public. ↩ The inefficient labor market can be caused by numerous reasons. Having dumb requirements and credentialism is one explanation. Having a high turnover rate is another. I'll be generous and think it has more to do with jobs getting more complex. When jobs are complex, it raises the transaction friction, which means the act of consuming liquidity is more costly. ↩ ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"When not to negotiate","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/2025/03/04/when-not-to-negotiate","content":"","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":null},{"title":"Understanding objectives​","type":1,"pageTitle":"When not to negotiate","url":"/blog/2025/03/04/when-not-to-negotiate#understanding-objectives","content":" In grand strategy, the most common optimization it aims to achieve is to maximize a country's long-term national interests.

Every advantage you concede doesn't bring you closer to resolution; it widens the power gap between you.  Think of it like feeding a stray cat. The first time might seem like a one-off kindness. But tomorrow? They'll be back, expecting more, getting aggressive if you don't deliver. That's the UO pattern.  What makes negotiation impossible is that UO people view compromise as weakness. Your willingness to meet halfway signals an opportunity for exploitation, not collaboration.  It is also a form of enablement that encourages more parasitic behaviors.

While these organizations are made by people, they are similar to a market where no single agent can influence its course of action. By design, they cannot appeal to morality or individuality.  As a result, most bureaucracies are optimized to grow as much as they can while maximizing the relative power gap between the institution and an independent agent.  Look into history and observe how often bureaucracies grow in personnel size and how infrequent they shed the size of their followers, managers, or employees?  The outcome of every bureaucracy has been the same: they keep growing until they can no longer finance themselves. Then, a debt collapse happens (which usually leads to large scale civil war or external invasion).  Every tax you pay, every paperwork you put up with, every time you waste on their rituals makes the bureaucracy more legitimized, more powerful, and harder to get rid of.  I've witnessed this pattern in smaller settings like corporates, local community clubs, even within online communities.  A Discord server initially allowed users to voice concerns at meetings. When participation grew, they changed rules to limit speaking time, then moved meetings to inconvenient times, then required pre-approval for topics. Each concession from users led to further restrictions, not progress. 1  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Cancel culture​","type":1,"pageTitle":"When not to negotiate","url":"/blog/2025/03/04/when-not-to-negotiate#cancel-culture","content":" Public apologies rarely satisfy online mobs.

If you ever tried to think independently and suggest different solutions that conflict with the online mob's idea of justice, you will often find yourself being very unpopular.  Like a bureaucracy, an online mob is no longer an individual that owns the ability to negotiate. Rather it has a new found purpose to consume and destroy as much as possible to justify and grow its existence.  When someone apologizes for a perceived transgression, the admission doesn't resolve the situation -- it accelerates it. The objective isn't correction or growth; it is punishment and social control.  The most prominent examples I have observed are conservative voices in social media before 2024 (peaked in 2020), where accounts get banned for conservative content, employments and contracts getting rescinded for conservative participation, businesses getting cancelled for accidental perception of racist expressions, and so on.  This contrasts sharply with traditional reconciliation models. Christian forgiveness (at its best) creates a path back to community for those who had sinned.

When I asked if they will take advantage of their partner's mistake and raise their status after the event, they hesitated but ultimately decided cooperation is more important than power.  In summary, both have the idea that their partner has UO over them, therefore they can't afford to lose a single argument or it would be harder for them to defend themselves in the next argument.

Or, it's a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  The problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn't clear if the rich was actually the problem.  In the French Revolution, it's not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It's more like the top 1% against the top 0.1%. Most of the common people don't even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  Put simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it's in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.

The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is deliberate or accidental.  Many things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  Example, the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford tertiary education to gain the cultural capital required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  If you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees / license to bypass these regulations are the root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind. Yet, you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  In fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  On a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China's Gaokao -- The same system that is the most unfair and repressive to lower class also happened to get the most support and defense from the lower class.  Gaokao creates &quot;unequal&quot; outcomes and &quot;widening social class,&quot; in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people &quot;accidentally&quot; creating social division.  In effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the a category I would classify as &quot;opportunity stealing hero&quot; (OSH).  If you are convinced that China's gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you'll also find that most state's public education don't do better.  In US, public schools spend $20k per student for the results of 20% illiteracy rate. Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  If the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  Yet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSH.  With 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  Must have a way to avoid competition, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.Decisions are undemocratic (regulations setup by &quot;think tanks&quot; and &quot;experts&quot;)Victims having &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; to net negative practices. (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)  With such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.

But no one else gets this right to create value out of nothing. While it's hard to say they are dishonest, there is no way we can know how accountable too.  In a competitive market, an unaccountable bank would face consequences for poor policies. In central bank's case, mostly its just &quot;bad luck&quot;, &quot;bad timing&quot;, &quot;oops&quot;.  For CB with weaker political power, it is possible for market players to force a competitive decision.

Right now I'll just focus on the normal recruiting industry we all know and love.)  Anticompetitive​  Have you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?  A great recruiter should be paid by the quality of candidates they hire. In practice, recruiters get paid by the number of candidates they closed.  This means there is no pressure to properly vet for candidates for employers, or no pressure to help job seekers land jobs. You pay your LinkedIn Premium and they play you for a fool.  In more competitive markets, there is a &quot;money back guarantee&quot; for people who are unsatisfied with the product. A simple way to make HR competitive is to also have a &quot;money back guarantee&quot; system, where the recruiter forfeits their commission if the candidate is bad, or if the candidate couldn't find a job.  Why don't we do it?  Undemocratic​  HR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  For example, HR policies routinely use expensive educational degrees as prerequisites for roles -- even when the actual performance gap between degree holders and non-degree holders is negligible in many real-world contexts.  In effect, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn't problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.  To find out if degrees, licenses, or other credentials are actually a competency signal, a scientific method would be to look at the data by systematically measuring the quality of both recruits and rejects using an objective function.  I have hardly met any HR that does this 2.  It doesn't help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world.  Degrees now function more like a &quot;ticket you buy for the chance to work&quot; that gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.  HR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects. I've suggested a simple way to do it.  Yet, there is simply no market, competitive, moral pressure to do so.  Victims with Stockholm​  Business owners, shareholders, and job seekers think we are better off with them.  What people don't ask is how many of the problems the HR / recruitment industry solves are problems created by a bureacracy (that recruiters themselves are part of).  Example: employment rights, unions, protection of workers supposedly protect workers from unfair labor practices (Stockholm warning). But this also make it much harder for business owners to hire and fire employees, thus justifying the need for HR / recruiters.  The 2nd order effect is that business are less willing to hire and invest in employees, given that underperforming employees are so hard to let go.  I can't make the call that we are better off without labor regulations. But its important to understand the more complex we make labor laws, the more power HR and recruiters get.  At some point, job seekers lose and business owners lose.

I believe most of the bad things in life are not intentional. It's very rare to meet someone with a mission to cause as much damage as they can while getting away with it.  This means its important to inspect for systems that are supposedly &quot;good&quot; but at some point stop serving the interest of the system consumer.  What I notice is that problems that are so complicated to need a middleman tends to attract &quot;careerist&quot;3 to setup uncompetitive bureaucracy (IE: rent-seeking toll).  &quot;But aren't the rich the real final boss?&quot;  It's too convenient, too big of the brush, and often results in bad policies. Instead, I think it's more helpful to expose people to the anatomy of how institutions can take advantage of the public.  So long as the public are uncritical about their practices, the bureacracy can keep masquerading as a value-creator when its a parasite 4.      Footnotes​ Interestingly, federal income taxes we paid for granted started when the CB was invented at 1913. ↩ I've spoke around recruiters during informal settings. In most of my conversations with recruiters, the best indicator of a good candidate is &quot;what other recruiters&quot; say about them. In logical settings, this is known as &quot;circular reasoning&quot;. It's as unscientific as &quot;just vibes&quot;. Yeah, you think people who make important decisions are more responsibile. ↩ Career usually mean something better than job and supposedly requires more respect. But rent-seeking can also be a career. The question is should the public sponsor such careers? ↩ Parasite is a strong word, but the classification is that it must grow infinitely at the expense of the host's strength. This is consistent with my observations. The Fed gets stronger everytime they print more money and do not hesitate to increase their personnel. Similarly, HR went from 0.5% workforce to 1.5% workforce from 1980 to 2020. In the same time with the growth of these institutions, their &quot;customers&quot; get weaker. This is unlike competitive economic systems (example Nvidia) where their growth is also followed by the growth in strength by their customers. ↩ ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"How to go viral on the internet","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/how-to-go-viral-on-the-internet","content":"","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":null},{"title":"I will not advertise this blog​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to go viral on the internet","url":"/blog/how-to-go-viral-on-the-internet#i-will-not-advertise-this-blog","content":" Given that commercial incentives will pollute the 'alpha' of such a strategy, I'd rather keep these signals unknown to most of the public.

In practice, idling looks like wasted cost, lost revenue. This philosophy is the result of us getting conditioned by centuries of economic model where labor time can be valued economically. It is hard escaping being a victim to this hustling mentality, where simply believing that if one can put in more hours one would be achieving more -- this view get more wrong with every progress made to automation and technology. When I'm composing music, in any given moment not all instruments are busy playing their own notes, yet somehow they are still able to create an &quot;effective symphony&quot; with so little activity from each individual. In fact, to achieve an effective symphony, it is necessary for pauses, emphasis, and passing spotlights to different parts and performers of the orchestra. The best composers or conductors don't make everyone play all the time. When I was an amateur, I thought the requirement to be a good composer is complexity, difficulty, and novelty, yet I notice a lot of great composers can get away with composition that is simple to play (C-major), cliched progressions (4/4 time signature) (1-4-5-6 progression) and still hitting the top charts. Inversely, a composition that is played by all parts of the orchestra constantly with complex maneuver are actually works done by an amateur. With the advent of digital music, it is now possible for composers to write in range and complexity that are impossible to perform. If difficulty and activity are signs of skill, then music topping the charts would have been electronic music with 10 instruments playing throughout the song at 200 BPM, with SFX automation clips stacked over one another. Clearly, the playlists we choose don't look like this. Given the lack of correlation (that is continuing to decrease) between activity and outcome, somehow businesses and people who want to improve their personal career are still stuck with the mindset that &quot;activity &gt;&gt; outcome&quot;.

Yet, most of us don't recognize how much conformism we do on a regularly basis.  It makes a lot of sense to follow the crowd. In data science, there is a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that is used very often and efficient to compute, especially if the application needs to make the prediction fast.  An example of a KNN is to associate a Japanese user with the average Japanese user. The software doesn't try to do fancy computation to model the user at high fidelity.  In financial markets, there is a trend following strategy, or ARIMA models, where the prediction of prices is based on past few day's prices. It's more &quot;braindead&quot; relative to exhaustively analyzing earnings report, growth rates, transcripts to predict prices and to generate a new valuation every time data changes.  Conformism brings order and stability, allowing societies to function smoothly. It facilitates the scaling of power and resources, which can enhance the collective evolutionary fitness of a group.  &quot;Trust the process&quot; works well in the sense that the group can save on computing and decision cost. The catch is that the process must keep working.  So a group of conformist who happened to be lucky enough to follow a right set of values will grow fast enough to destroy the population of a group of deviants who are either busy doing their own thing, or busy disagreeing among themselves.  However, if the conformist values misalign, mistakes cascades and wrong social directions are hard to stop -- the Pied Piper of Hamlin will lead all rats to drown in the river.  Conformism can also be exploited a subset of manipulative deviants, as values get hijacked to benefit a small cabal of deviants (cult leaders and equivalents).

This raises questions about the evolutionary viability of independent thinking and deviance.  In fact, we could use the market perspective to understand the quantitative tradeoffs and ROI between conformism and independent thinking.  In most advanced economies, the number of salaried workers (conformists) is much higher than the number of entrepreneurs (deviants).  Interestingly, the average earnings of salaried workers is higher than the average earnings of entrepreneurs -- an evidence of the survival advantage of conformism. 2  In ancient China, independent barbarians get defeated or absorbed by the more conforming empire.

By observing how AI agents respond to different reward functions, we can gain a better understanding of when and why humans might lean towards conformism or independent thinking.  So far, the most interesting AI agents used to simulate human cooperation is the Axelrod project.  The discovery is that the greatest survivors are agents who employ &quot;Tit-for-tat&quot; strategies in iterative Prisoner's Dilemma games.  Perhaps, a similar agent simulation could be used to discover the natural bias of agents towards conformism or defiance when status conscious becomes a parameter.      Footnotes​ Sigh, I knew you would take it the wrong way. I don't mean these people get less sex. Reproduction success in this context is more like the ability to replicate more independent thinkers.

FP emphasizes pure functions, meaning functions do not modify variables but instead generate new ones as an output. Pure functions are &quot;pure&quot; because they always return the same output for the same argument values. In effect, it serves as a very simple motif for any program.  OOP focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, so state changes are supported and behavior can be extended.  The natural language equivalent of FP is the use of alphabets (English), character strokes (Chinese), hiragana (Japanese) to convey meaning.  However, users of the natural language will eventually realize that using only basic building blocks result in lots of redundancy. Also, if the sequence of characters repeats too often, it also gets confusing to interpret.  A programmer that deals with a functional programming framework will also come to feel the same problem after working on the project long enough (redudancy, confusion during long sequences.)  The natural language equivalent of OOP is the use of prefixes, suffixes, and roots to convey meaning.

Take the word &quot;carbon monoxide&quot; as an example. Each part of the word means something specific:  Carbon: a type of elementMono: meaning &quot;one&quot;Oxide: a type of compound derived from oxygen element  When you put these pieces together, they form a new word that tells you it's a compound made of one carbon atom. Even if you're not a chemistry expert, the word gives you clues about what it means!  This modular approach is cool because it lets us understand and create new words by combining familiar parts. It's like how you can mix different LEGO pieces to build something entirely new.  However, the linearity and locality of English means you will often get very long words when trying to describe something specific or technical.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, which has 45 letters, refers to a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust.  How it came to be this long is because you want to fit and extend multiple classes into an expression pneumo, micro, silica, osis, and you required the locality, IE: fixing all the motifs together so those classes don't get accidentally spilled to a different word.

This is similar to object-oriented programming in software, where objects can include other objects or inherit their properties.  Most of the oldest and common characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects.  For example:  日 (rì) means &quot;sun&quot;月 (yuè) means &quot;moon&quot;木 (mù) means &quot;tree&quot;  Just like how you mix LEGO pieces, Chinese combines these common words to become themes of other words, known as 部首 (bùshǒu).  明 (míng) is made by combining 日 (sun) and 月 (moon). Together, they mean something bright.晨 (chén) means &quot;dawn&quot; and uses 日 (sun) to show light.果 (guǒ) means &quot;fruit&quot; and uses 木 (tree), showing where fruit comes from.  Unlike English where expression get extended by adding suffixes and elongating the word, Chinese extend expression by fitting multiple &quot;components&quot; (IE: the primary characters) into a box and identifying it as a unique character. You can treat each Chinese character as an individual script file.  This compression means Chinese has a natural advantage to use very little words to convey lots of meaning.  Example 1:​  掌声的嗜好成了瘾症  The preference for applause has become an addiction.  Example 2:​  在深海漩涡里翻腾摧毁一切只剩下无可挽回的罪人  The waves of the whirlpool in a deep sea are breaking everything, leaving behind only a guilty person with no redemption.  In effect, Chinese has demonstrated the advantage of a more compressed abstraction, most obviously the number of phonemes required to finish a sentence.  However, anyone who has done enough software will soon guess the next problem with Chinese component approach.  Chinese has a lot of characters. In effect, each character is a class of its own, therefore your database of words requires a huge collection.  Unlike English where you only need 26 characters (maybe more if you also want to include Greek symbols or accented symbols), Chinese has between 3000 to 100,000 characters (depending on the level of complexity of the dictionary) you are using.  Not only that Chinese has more characters to track because each expression &quot;wants&quot; a word to represent it, we either have to create a new word to represent the expression, or we have to borrow a reserved word to represent it (IE: similar but have different meanings). This is the software equivalent of &quot;class collision&quot;.  While one can always squash more components into the script, the obvious disadvantage is that the character becomes harder to write and unnecessarily niche. Check out the abomination of the few examples that still survived today:  攀 (Pān) (Climbing)罐 (Guàn) (Can)  One obvious solution is to use compounded words to represent the expression.  塑料 (sùliào) (plastic)​  塑: shape料: material  细菌 (xìjūn) (bacteria)​  细: fine菌: fungus  方言 (fāngyán) (dialect)​  方: square, direction言: speech  You notice this compounding style is very similar to English method of linearly extending a word with suffix: EG: &quot;hydrophobic&quot; as &quot;water-repelling&quot;.  However, the problem with Chinese that the characters they can extend is restricted by all the options they can use from the 3000-word dictionary in the first place. 3000 characters isn't enough to cover every concept relative to English where you can use any word as suffixes, prefixes, and roots.  This abstraction makes Chinese very &quot;opinionated&quot; in terms of how concepts can be extended, much like our experience as developers with OOP languages.  You can observe this disadvantage very obviously during EN and CN attempts to describe a technical or scientific concept (CN is much more ambiguous than EN).

In the meantime around 8th century, the Japanese had the demand to represent the sounds of the spoken language more accurately. They invented a &quot;manyogana&quot; system, where Chinese characters were used to represent phonetic sounds rather than their original meanings. Its the equivalent of repurposing a class with different functions (bad, bad, bad idea in software).  Eventually, sounds and phonemes became a mainstream way of encoding language. To avoid the confusion of shared class problem, the Japanese adopted 2 new writing systems: hiragana and katakana to represent sounds.  Hiragana, a syllabary with a limited set of characters, serves a functional purpose by providing phonetic values. But independently it runs into the problem of FP -- expressing a complete sentence is lengthy, confusing, and hard to read.  To make things more readable, the Japanese combined hiragana with kanji. The result is a writing system using 2 distinct character dictionaries.  From a software developer's perspective, this is a maintenance nightmare. It's like adding a plugin (hiragana) to your monolith (kanji). Not only do the user needs to understand each character from kanji, now they also need to understand each character from hiragana.  But this combination also solves some big problems, like &quot;class collision&quot; and limited ways to expand experienced by CN. It's like giving LEGO pieces different colors.  For example, the kanji 生 (せい, しょう) can mean &quot;life&quot; or &quot;raw,&quot; and when combined with different hiragana, it forms different words.  生まれる(うまれる) (生-mameru): to be born生み出す(うみだす) (生-midasu) : to create, to invent生きる (いきる) (生-kiru) : to live  This is just a tip of the iceberg for Japanese interaction between kanji component and hiragana component. More advanced use of langage include compounded kanji that result in different pronounciation.  Example kanji 月 (つき / tsuki), which means &quot;moon&quot; independently. When combined compounded with different kanji results in different hiragana pronounces.  月刊 (げっかん / gekkan): means &quot;monthly,&quot; like a magazine you get every month.一月 (いちがつ / ichigatsu): means &quot;January,&quot;満月 (まんげつ / mangetsu): means &quot;full moon&quot;  The base tsuki can have its state changed to gek-, gatsu, getsu depending on context.

If something valuable was already done, why waste energy to give back the catalyst (ie: the currency)?  The problem happens when the currency gets spent on more things than it was made to spend on (IE: buying labor for social services becomes salary to spend and compete on limited goods) -- Taxes ensures the velocity of created money is not infinite.  In practice people can always argue why they don't need to return the currency, so its hard to take back as much money as we created.  Whose stuff gets done?​  The state can create money to buy for things they want, but in practice you can bet the decisions aren't fair (IE: what the state wants to buy might not be what the people want to buy).  In fact, the state can just set up a shell company with their entourage, print some money and pay his friends and declaring his friends are being &quot;paid to do social work&quot;. -- This is wastage in a nutshell.

Crowding out​  If the state prints money to hire workers, then it means someone else would lose the worker they wanted to hire to do their work.  In a free market, the most important work gets done first and that is reflected by prices and bids.  When the state spends money, it is unclear if the work that needs to be done are the most important ones.  When suboptimal decisions are made and financed, in effect that is also a net loss to the people.

When individuals or organizations lack trust in a process or a system, they tend to hedge their bets, to take smaller, more conservative risks. This leads to slower growth and missed opportunities.  If you are into gambling, trading, or investing, perhaps you might have came across a mathematical concept known as Kelly criterion.  The Kelly Criterion, a mathematical formula for determining the optimal size of a bet, illustrates this point perfectly. It states that the optimal fraction of capital to bet is the edge (the expected return on investment) divided by the odds. People size their bets based on win probability and expected return on investment.  Details Kelly Bet size  Basically, the Kelly table or heatmap shows how much percent of your holdings you should bet on a bet with a certain probability of winning.  Example For example, if you have 60% win rate and you win $1 dollar for every $1 dollar you bet, then your kelly optimal bet size (abbreviated as K) is 20% of total portfolio. At 80% win rate and 1.7 ROI, you bet 68% of your portfolio.  However, the thing most people don't understand is &quot;Kelly Optimal&quot; is only optimal in long-term capital generation, but not in volatility.  From chart below, volatility grows exponentially with kelly bet sizing.  Details Volatility The chart is actually just theoretical, and the curve depends on various parameters. I have built a visualization for this here  This means in practice, Kelly optimal bet is actually a bad bet and seldom done in real life 3 because of how often it leads to bankruptcy, financial ruin, or irrecoverable drawdowns.  After controlling for volatility, the risk-adjusted kelly optimal is around 0.5K. The growth rate of capital is cut to half, at the benefit of reducing volatility by over 80%.  Quantitatively, this is what I meant by doubting the process.  Because one doubts processes, they will implement rational devices, guards, systems to avoid overbetting, leading to unlevered capital growth.  When one &quot;trusts the process&quot;, they will go full Kelly in every thing they do. This often works out well in the short term, and if the decision or judgment happens to be right.  The &quot;cost of doubt&quot; that was paid may not necessarily be limited to computation cost, but also includes &quot;uncaptured opportunities&quot;.  A belief system that trusts the process grows faster than a belief system that is more rational and rightfully conservative during boom times.  Of course, the risk of being levered on the wrong decision is high, even catastrophic.  Betting the farm on a flawed idea, blindly following a charismatic leader, or investing heavily in a failing venture can lead to ruin.  We see dogmatic religions or belief systems that demand absolute obedience in the process to fall apart or get wiped out in history very often.  This is why a healthy dose of skepticism and critical thinking is always essential.

This is only one perspective.  It is also possible its an economically destrictive practice that was still done regardless. The alternative explanation is they act as a &quot;cost of admission&quot; to a particular belief system, ensuring that only those truly committed are willing to participate.  The expense of rituals acts as a powerful commitment device. By investing significant time, money, effort -- sunk costs are intentionally driven within individuals and demands increased dedication and stakes in its success.  Think about joining a gym and paying for a year-long membership. The upfront cost makes you more likely to actually go to the gym, justifying the initial investment and reinforcing your commitment to fitness.  Similarly, the investment in a wedding ceremony, a down payment on a house, or years of dedicated study for a profession all serve as commitment devices, solidifying one's investment in the associated belief systems (marriage, property ownership, career).  The sunk costs create a powerful disincentive to abandon the existing commitment. It's like being locked into a long-term contract -- even if a better offer comes along, the penalty for breaking the contract might be too high.

Women are more status conscious, so there is a disadvantage in the capacity to hold independent thoughts.

Inversely, a man that is burdened by status-conscious will have as much trouble being creative. ↩ This theory also support the observation that many great art in ancient history was done by non-hetero people (Michelangelo, Nikola Tesla).

Financial independence can only be realized by the mechanism &quot;compound interest&quot; -- a force that makes your money grow exponentially.

It's as braindead as planting a seed that grows into a money tree, providing shade for you while you lounge all day.  Compound interest works by reinvesting your earnings so that future growth is based on both your initial capital and the accumulated returns. Financial influencers often paint a picture of an exponential curve. Advisors often tell people to start early and young and you will be 10x riicher than those who started 10 years later.  &quot;Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world.

This imbalance reveals a critical flaw: the dream of universal financial freedom and infinite compound interest is built on an unsustainable model.

Bandits steal and go to jail. CB steals from the entire world for 100 years, and still getting thanked for it.  The trick to pull this off is to make sure that:  the voters get &quot;rich&quot; voting for youthe voters don't realize what you are doingthe voters understand how screwed they will be if they don't play along the system.  By devaluing currencies, you &quot;increase the value&quot; of the owner's portfolio. This shows up in higher house prices, higher stock prices, where people happily ask the CB for lower interest rates to protect value.  People think they are getting richer being cooperative with the CB scheme. Much of it is a consequence of usury against the working class.  You create fake money to compete resources with real people.You create fake money which then gets lended to people, which then pays you back with interest earned by real labor. 1  In the past, usury was done by a selected group of people which made them obvious and unpopular, thus they get punished very quickly.  This time, by sharing the spoils with owners, they will have the owners happily work for them to preserve their increased wealth value.  Of course, the increase in wealth is meaningless if they are illiquid. Most of the overvalued houses and stocks can't be sold. Especially for houses, selling an overvalued house means you have to buy yet another overvalued house. 2  In fact, it is in the CB and governmnents interest to pump the economy full of liquidity and raise prices as high as they can. Because it means they get to raise more taxes from every transaction.  Also, by making assets worth more and labor worth less, more people will want to &quot;do nothing&quot; and &quot;start owning&quot;.  People who do nothing are convenient because they are no longer strong or independent to challenge the power or the system.  The best part? By being an owner, you join the ranks of the globalist elite -- you do anything to fight against the working class to preserve your secondary status as a dog fed by the CB. 3      Footnotes​ This is also why most banks are perfectly happy that their loans never gets paid back.

Even a well-mixed track can benefit from proper mastering.  In an ideal environment, your mix is so good that all your mastering does is raising the level until it peaks at 0dB (-0.3db is a safe spot).  The reason why you don't let your mix get so loud (and hence skipping the mastering step) is because sometimes you want to boost the low-end, mid, or high-end with multi-band compression, or other effects later 1, and if your mix is too loud you won't be able to reverse those effects.  It is important to understand the primary objective of mastering is to make the track sound &quot;more like other tracks&quot; created by the industry, on a spectral context.  With loudness normalization by streaming platforms, you don’t have to compete for volume. Mastering is now a competition with yourself to achieve better dynamics and spectral balance.  Don't overthink it.

However, it doesn't enhance sound quality or balance frequencies like mastering does.  Normalization is a basic level adjustment, whereas mastering is a comprehensive process that improves your music's overall sound.

Ignore the advice that you need a professional because you &quot;don't have what it takes&quot;.  IMO, think the biggest difference between a mastering engineer and a bedroom producer is mostly due to differences in equipment (professional speakers and sound-treated environment are really expensive).  Todays software is good enough to let a bedroom producer master with normal equipment with good enough results, so again I encourage you not to overthink it.  If you are producing for millions, then it will make more sense to hire a professional mastering engineer.

In fact, there is an open-sourced tool known as Matchering that provides mastering features.  From the results, it seems that it is as good as a professional from the 80th percentile under perfect conditions 2.  That said, I do not recommend using AI or Matchering for mastering if you have no idea what you are doing.  There is a high chance the AI will give you something that sounds convincing and you just scoop it all up without understanding what it is doing. This is not a good practice.  You will grow to be dependent on AI and Matchering, they will accidentally give you a horrible master and you will just distribute it carelessly and ruin your reputation.  You should know what you are doing, what you are trying to achieve, and what the AI has done to your mix. However, when you do end up getting to that point, it is also a time when you wouldn't need their help.  I think AI and Matchering is a good point of reference for beginners to learn what it does to the mix and try to do it yourself.

But when you are working to make a good master, you should inspect for obvious problems.  One good way is to do it visually.  Load the wave sample for the mix and the reference track into your DAW and check for obvious differences in spectral energy and peaks.If you master's wave ends up looking very close to the reference track, usually it is good enough. 3There are cases when master wave and reference wave looks similar, but loudness is different. Usually this is a result of a &quot;spectral masking&quot; and &quot;imbalanced EQ, or &quot;upset tonal balance&quot;. You may not need to make a decision about it 3.      Footnotes​ When producers say &quot;leaving some headroom&quot; this is what they meant. Anything above 0db means no more headroom. Anything below 0db means more headroom. ↩ In practice, you will not get perfect conditions unless you blantantly ripoff every part of the reference track, like arrangement, composition, spectral balance (EG: your track has 8b verse, 2b break, 8b chorus, and reference track also followed the [8,2,8] arrangement). AI mastering tools like Matchering can produce decent results, but they lack the decision-making of an experienced engineer. Use it as a starting point, but learn enough to get out of it asap. ↩ A visual comparison can help, but always trust your ears first. If your master sounds balanced and competitive with a reference track, it's usually good enough. ↩ ↩2 ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Fruity Limiter","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/mixing/basic/fruity_limiter","content":"Fruity Limiter placeholder","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":"Next"},{"title":"Fruity Parametric EQ 2","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/mixing/basic/fruity_parametric_eq2","content":"Fruity Parametric EQ 2 Placeholder","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":"Next"},{"title":"What is Mixing?","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/mixing/what_is_mixing","content":"","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":"Next"},{"title":"Why mix?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is Mixing?","url":"/docs/mixing/what_is_mixing#why-mix","content":" You have lots of instrumental layers in each song and you want to balance their volume and placement (putting the drummer further behind).You might be recording different people seperately for your track instead of doing all in one take.You want to add effects (reverb and echo-like sound to your piano to sound more emotional).

At K greater than 1.5, your chances of ruin gets extremely high.  In fact, you notice that ruin can happen even before K reaches 1.5 when your edge or odds goes high enough.

Note When odds get large enough, you notice a K=0.7 would outperformed a K=1 strategy 50% of the time within 100 games, from the probability density chart.

Unlike static calculations, this demonstrates the actual trial experience where p-values start at 1 (no evidence) and gradually decrease as evidence accumulates. Why do this? Traditional method Recruits a target amount of people, then measuring the effect differences.Has an &quot;over-recruitment&quot; problem. Sequential method Recruit sequentially, updating the resultsCancels experiment as soon as enough participants has shown significant difference between control and treatment.Early lucky or unlucky observations throw the experiment off in tangent, especially if there is STD for control and treatment, and if STD is unknown. With this simulation, we... Check if a certain trial is worth doing or not, by sampling the distribution of required observations to conclude a trial.Budget the cost of recruiting, especially if each observation costs a lot. EG: if median trials-to-significance is 150, it is recommended to recruit up to 200 observation to run a single experiment.

Then there needs to be an agreement to what each of us are allowed to do with our master. Don't get caught cheating. This is not a permission or signal from me that cheating is OK. I get that artists break rules all the time and who I am to stop anyone. I won't list examples so no one gets any ideas, but I am aware of some tricks. If you are unsure, ask first. The important thing is now that you are not working alone, everyone will be accountable for each other's mistakes too so please be considerate.

We're here to learn from each other. If we stay respectful to our rights and vision, there is no need to become competitors. There are no rules, but here's a good priority to decide how hard you want to work. Honor your artistic vision firstMake sure you have enough time / money to finish the jobAsk for tips and tricks. If I know about it, its likely I'll share it with you. ... Better be done than be perfect      Footnotes​ This is very tricky, especially when your project has tempo changes, key modulation, and non 4/4 time signatures. Sharing the project files is the most straightforward way to avoid excessive metadata descriptions. Also, please don't name it like mix-master-v1-final-final-v2-really_final.wav (I know we all did at some point) ↩ Just for convenience purposes. In my experience, lyrics, phonemes, timing, tuning, voicebank get revised all the time so there is a constant access and edit to the SVP. It is usually not threatening to the copyright as a solo file due to how chaotic it is. If you are really worried of people reproducing the tuned-voice, you can always copy the original and randomize automation effects. ↩ I'm contemplating if it should be optional. It's annoying to keep around. Its more for convenience when we do actually need it. ↩ ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Storyboard Guide","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/partners/writer/storyboard-guide","content":"","keywords":"software development  music production  programming tutorials  web development  React  TypeScript  business analysis  data science  probability calculators  gacha analysis  A/B testing  David Len  nelverse","version":"Next"},{"title":"Requirements​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Storyboard Guide","url":"/partners/writer/storyboard-guide#requirements","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Personal details​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Storyboard Guide","url":"/partners/writer/storyboard-guide#personal-details","content":" Not necessary for your Name, Age, Gender, Race, Religion, Nationality.
