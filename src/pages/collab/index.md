# Let's Collaborate!

Welcome to my collaboration page. It's basically a resume page but less formal.

[Get my contact](https://gravatar.com/neldivad)

## About Me

- **My Strengths**:
  - Frontend: Typescript, React
  - Backend and web infra: Python, Docker, PostgreSQL
  - AI and ML research (though its moving so fast I could be months behind)
  - Music producer with FL Studio

## Contracts I Accept

1. **Short-Term Projects**: Only for music related projects (singles). 
2. **Long-Term Collaborations**: Ongoing partnerships for music production (album), software development. Ideally you already have an established team and a good track record that can convince me to go out of my nomadic ways.
3. **Consulting Work**: Hourly or daily rate consultations for software, web-infra, music production.


## How to Reach Me
I'm mainly on Discord and I spend my whole day doing stuff. With the amount of request I get and stuff I regularly build, I may not respond to every invitation on time (I also get a lot of spam from bots).

[Sending me a lot of donations](https://gravatar.com/neldivad) has the best chance of getting my attention and curiosity. 

## Payment Terms

- **Short-term projects**: 
    - Deposit: 50% deposit, settled within 2 weeks after completion.
    - Milestone-Based Payments: more details on the project
- **Consulting work**: 
    - Hourly. Depends on the expertise and stakes of the project.
- **Long-term collaboration**: 
    - Best done in person.

## FAQ
### Are you expensive?

I don't optimize for earnings. It depends on the project. I've been sold to work on projects are net negative to my cashflow because I liked the team, mission. I've rejected offers that promised me sky because I disliked the team, mission, restrictions. 

That said, I've worked with enough people to know that life is too short to work with unserious people. **The best signal starts with a good offer**. 

In my experience, those who offers the least are the same people who make me work the hardest. Not in terms of workload, labor hours, or complexity in responsibilities. Rather, its the poor decisions that eventually cascades to stress and burnout from me. 

My [blog](/blog) will occasionally have posts about my business experiences, of course with respects to privacy and NDA of my partners.

### You do so many things, can you focus? 
If I'm under a contract (say music), then I will only work on (music related) contracts. 

For software, usually just a prototype, proof of concept, then handover. Maintaining software is a long term commitment. Unless the team is really something I look forward to be part of (game dev, AI research, audio engineering, etc.), its more probable I agree only to short-term contracts for this category.
