# Let's Collaborate!

Welcome to my collaboration page. It's basically a resume page but less formal.

[Get my contact](https://gravatar.com/neldivad)

## About Me
- Frontend: Typescript, React
- Backend and web infra: Python, Docker, PostgreSQL
- AI and ML research (though its moving so fast I could be months behind)
- Music producer with FL Studio

## Contracts I Accept

1. **Short-Term Projects**: Only for music related projects (singles). 
2. **Long-Term Collaborations**: Ongoing partnerships for music production (album), software development. Ideally you already have an established team and a good track record that can convince me to go out of my nomadic ways.
3. **Consulting Work**: Hourly or daily rate consultations for software, web-infra, music production.


## How to Reach Me
I'm mainly on Discord and I spend my whole day doing stuff. With the amount of request I get and stuff I regularly build, I may not respond to every invitation on time (I also get a lot of spam from bots).

Spam my Youtube comments, X DMs. [Sending me a lot of donations](https://gravatar.com/neldivad) has the best chance of getting my attention and curiosity. 

If I'm not on a Discord VC, I may be able to respond. 

## Payment Terms

- **Short-term projects**: 
    - Deposit: 50% deposit, settled within 2 weeks after completion.
    - Milestone-Based Payments: more details on the project
    - Example: [Song transcription](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FOI4PvLho) $100-$250 for a single song (based on length, BPM, number of instruments). 
- **Consulting work**: 
    - Hourly. Depends on the expertise and stakes of the project.
- **Long-term collaboration**: 
    - Best done in person.

## FAQ
### Are you expensive?

I don't optimize for earnings. It depends on the project. I've worked on projects that are net negative to my cashflow because I liked the team, mission. I've rejected offers that promised me sky because I disliked the team, mission, restrictions. 

That said, I've worked with enough people to know that life is too short to work with unserious people. **The best signal starts with a good offer**. [^1] 

[^1]: In my experience, those who offers the least are the same people who make me work the hardest. Not in terms of workload, labor hours, or complexity in responsibilities. Rather, [its the poor decisions that eventually cascades to stress and burnout from me.](/blog/ineffective-leaders). My [blog](/blog) will occasionally have posts about my business experiences, of course with respects to privacy and NDA of my partners.

*If you are from MY/SG and worry that my rates don't match your currency, I do have the preference to help local. If I can see you in person, I'm happy to talk more.*

### You do so many things, can you focus? 
If I'm under a contract (say music), then I will only work on (music related) contracts. 

Maintaining software is a long term commitment. Unless the team is really something I look forward to be part of (game dev, AI research, audio engineering, etc.), its more probable I agree only to short-term contracts for this category. 

A short-term contract for software looks like a prototype, proof of concept that was vibe-coded. If it's enough, or if you want to understand how I approach those problems, this is something you can get my input. (Example: RAG system for your invoices, website layout, etc.)
