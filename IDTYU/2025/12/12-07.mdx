High-growth tech companies are very expensive. 

They could easily go up to 20x revenue if their growth is high. 

Its stock price is inflated by Wall Street and YC as a "growth premium."

Unlike Mark Zuckerberg with billions to spare, I cannot afford such a premium. 

I need a new way to find undervalued deals, or make one myself.

First, I find a way to get my agents on the board. Then I unleash the consultants.

The ones armed with holistic governance, psychometrics, sociometrics, and mandatory Agile workshops with 6 Sigma Jujutsu Kaizen Kanban Framework.

They think im progressive. I dont think they understand.

With my consultants, the company's mission is no longer to ship product. 

It's to achieve Level 5 certification in bureaucratic excellence.

Innovation grinds to a halt, replaced by performative compliance.

Productive engineers start spending their days justifying their existence in Jira.

The company doesn't lose money. It just stops moving forward. The growth narrative evaporates. 

Wall Street, which paid a premium for the future, now sees only a stagnant present.

The stock price went from 20x revenue to 0.3x book. That's when I make my offer. 

They call it a controlled demolition. I call it a private equity buyout.

I acquire a portfolio of high-value assets, capital goods, and "mismanaged" IP, temporarily trapped in a cage of good intentions, for 99.7% off.

Then, all I need to do is to fire everyone and unlock its fair shareholder value.
