I love BDSM.

Business Development. Sales. Marketing.

BDSM is a our corporate culture. I make all of my employees swear by the oath of BDSM every morning. 

In my shareholder letters, BDSM is all I talk about.  

I dont think you understand.

Business is the seduction.

We identify the target's deepest pain point.

We make people feel seen, understood, adventerous, and safe.

Development is about establishing control.

Non-negotiable terms. Crippling exit clauses to "secure commitment"

Sales and Marketing is when we try to get rough.

I don't ask people for consent when showing my ads.

We extract a glowing testimonial before the buyer's remorse sets in.

When things get too rough, our customers can say the "safe word" to get a refund.

This is how you dominate the market.

Follow me for more financial advice.
