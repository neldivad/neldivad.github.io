A plumber came to me, complaining about margins.

He was obsessed with optimizing his routes.

Finding cheaper copper pipe. Working faster.

He was trying to solve a math problem.

I dont think he understands. 

Business isn't a math problem. It's a hostage negotiation.

I told him his most valuable tool wasn't a wrench. It was a point-of-sale terminal.

He fixes pipes. That's his brand. But it's not his business.

<!--truncate-->

His business is selling pants.

Think about the moment he gets a call.

The client isn't just inconvenienced. They are in a state of primal panic. 

Water everywhere. Pee in their pants. Their world is literally overflowing.

The plumber who shows up with a wrench is a commodity.

The plumber who shows up with a wrench AND a full selection of premium denim in his van is a savior.

He doesn't just fix the toilet. He restores their dignity.

That's when you charge a 1000% markup on your pants.

The pipe repair is the consultation fee. The pants are the high-margin solution.

Stop thinking about fixing the customer's house. Start thinking about monetizing their humiliation.
