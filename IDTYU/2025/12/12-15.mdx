I am a humble owner of an LGBT company.

They see the posters in the hall. The acronym on our shareholder presentations.

They nod, they smile. They think we are a family.

I dont think they understand

LGBT means Let's Grow Business Together.

People think we are inclusive. 

We include everyone for unpaid weekend work. 

It's not a demand. It is company culture.

It's an opportunity for us to "Grow Biz Together."

When I deny a raise, it's because we must "reinvest in the biz together."

I don't need to pay for anyone's loyalty with cash.

I purchase it with a 4-letter acronym buzzword.

It's the highest ROI I've ever seen.

Follow me for more financial advice.
