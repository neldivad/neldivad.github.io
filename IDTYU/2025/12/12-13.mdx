Im a humble owner of a money printer. 

Your parents will tell you to build a business from the ground up. They are teaching you to be a peasant.

Every morning, I press a button. Trillion of dollars pump out of thin air.

This isn't a stimulus. It's a sedative.

Your "hard-earned" profits from your coffee shop are diluted into meaninglessness.

The price of the building your shop is in? Its going through the roof.

<!--truncate-->

The stocks of the company that sells you coffee beans? They start swelling like the thing under me.

I have made the act of creating less profitable than the act of owning.

Eventually, you ask. 

Why risk building when you can just buy? Why innovate when you can just index?

A nation of founders is a nation of rebels. A nation of landlords and shareholders is a nation of dependents.

They don't challenge the system. They pray for me to keep their passive income going.

If you are a worker, you think what I'm doing is bad for you. 

I dont think you understand.

You already voted for me when you wanted to keep your pensions.

I'm not printing money. I am printing consent to rule over you.

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context
Central banks are some of the best scheme one can cook up. 

Bandits steal and go to jail. CB steals from the entire world for 100 years, and still getting thanked for it. 

The trick to pull this off is to make sure that:
- the voters get "rich" voting for you 
- the voters don't realize what you are doing 
- the voters understand how screwed they will be if they don't play along the system.

By devaluing currencies, you "increase the value" of the owner's portfolio. This shows up in higher house prices, higher stock prices, where people happily ask the CB for lower interest rates to protect value. 

People think they are getting richer being cooperative with the CB scheme. Much of it is a consequence of **usury against the working class.**

- You create fake money to compete resources with real people. 
- You create fake money which then gets lended to people, which then pays you back with interest earned by real labor. [^1]

[^1]: This is also why most banks are perfectly happy that their loans never gets paid back. The money lended to you is not even real. The best thing they can ask for is you pledging to work for them for 35 years.  

In the past, usury was done by a selected group of people which made them obvious and unpopular, thus they get punished very quickly. 

This time, by sharing the spoils with owners, they will have the owners happily work for them to preserve their increased wealth value. 

Of course, the increase in wealth is meaningless if they are illiquid. Most of the overvalued houses and stocks can't be sold. Especially for houses, selling an overvalued house means you have to buy yet another overvalued house. [^2]

[^2]: High valuation only matters if you get to sell at the top and buy them back at the bottom. Selling at the top and buying at the top does nothing to your relative wealth. 

In fact, it is in the CB and governmnents interest to pump the economy full of liquidity and raise prices as high as they can. Because it means they get to raise more taxes from every transaction. 

Also, by making assets worth more and labor worth less, more people will want to "do nothing" and "start owning". 

People who do nothing are convenient because they are no longer strong or independent to challenge the power or the system. 

The best part? By being an owner, you join the ranks of the globalist elite -- you do anything to fight against the working class to preserve your secondary status as a dog fed by the CB. [^3] 

[^3]: Unless you own the government and politics, you are still a second class citizen regardless of how much wealth you have. Especially if most of those wealth can be frozen by the CB network.
