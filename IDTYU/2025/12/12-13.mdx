Im a humble owner of a money printer. 

Your parents will tell you to build a business from the ground up. They are teaching you to be a peasant.

My job is not to foster your little ventures. My job is to manage the herd.

And a herd of entrepreneurs is a stampede and chaos waiting to happen.

So, every morning, I press a button. Trillion of dollars pump out of thin air.

This isn't a stimulus. It's a sedative.

Your "hard-earned" profits from your coffee shop are diluted into meaninglessness.

But the price of the building your shop is in? It soars.

<!--truncate-->

The stocks of the company that sells you coffee beans? They start swelling like the thing under me.

I have made the act of creating less profitable than the act of owning.

Why risk building when you can just buy? Why innovate when you can just index?

A nation of founders is a nation of rebels. A nation of landlords and shareholders is a nation of dependents.

They don't challenge the system. They pray for me to keep their passive income going.

If you are a worker, you think what I'm doing is bad for you. 

I dont think you understand.

You already voted for me when you wanted to keep your pensions. When you are getting free Ozempics from your insurance. 

I'm not printing money. I am printing consent to rule over you.

Follow me for more financial advice.
