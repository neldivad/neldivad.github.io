I insist my rival portfolio companies embrace radical inclusivity.

I told them its important to be progressive at this modern age.

My one golden rule? Everyone must be encouraged to speak.

Engineers in the marketing sync. HR in the product roadmap review.

The junior intern's opinion on the Q4 budget must be heard and "validated."

I dont think they understand. 

<!--truncate-->

Decisions that once took an hour now take a week of "stakeholder alignment."

Everyone is talking about what color they should have for the bike shed instead of how the rocket should be built. 

The entire office now looks like a UN conference with 200 seats and people lining up to speak for 2 minutes each.

A leader who can't make a decision without universal consensus is not a leader. 

They are a Zoom breakout-room facilitator.

Without growth, their valuation tanks. And I get to buy them off the market at 95% discount. 

Then, all I need to do is to fire everyone and replace the company with my boys to unlock all of the remaining asset value. 

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context
Same trick as the scrum master. 

Go woke, go broke -- is what the finance industry commonly observe. 

Yet, there doesn't seem to have a shortage of executives who are more than happy to drive down the value of the company. 

How did you think Ubisoft got bought by Tencent at 90% discount? 

When you understand incentives, and when you see who is buying, every policy starts to make sense.
