I insist my rival portfolio companies embrace radical inclusivity.

I told them its important to be progressive at this modern age.

I tell them to invite everyone to every important meeting.

Engineers in the marketing sync. HR in the product roadmap review.

And my one golden rule -- everyone must be encouraged to speak.

The junior intern's opinion on the Q4 budget must be heard and "validated."

I dont think they understand.

Decisions that once took an hour now take a week of "stakeholder alignment."

Everyone is talking about what color they should have for the bike shed instead of the rocket. 

The entire office now looks like a united nations conference with 200 seats and people lining up to speak for 2 minutes each.

Productivity doesn't just slow down. It dies.

A leader who can't make a decision without universal consensus is not a leader. 

They are a Zoom breakout-room facilitator.

Without growth, their valuation tanks. And I get to buy them off the market at 95% discount. 

Then, all I need to do is to fire everyone and replace the company with my boys to unlock all of the remaining asset value. 

Follow me for more financial advice.
