A girl making less than $100 a month on OF came to me for advice.

Her product was fine. (I was her beta-tester). Her marketing was the problem. 

I don't think she understands

There's plenty of other girls posting dance videos online. Many of them are already doing it for free. 

I told her to stop selling to the entertained. Start selling to the invisible.

Find men on Twitter with anime profile pictures and fewer than 100 followers. 

Like one of their posts. Follow them.

This man never gets any engagement ever. When you like any of his post, he will get a notification from someone with a very sexy profile picture. 

He will click her profile and engage with her linktree.

Her revenue erected as fast as her customer's session. 

Eventually, she quit her career. Pivoted to become a corporate recruiter.

She was failing. Until she remembered my lesson.

She started hunting the desperate graduates with "Open to Work" banners on LinkedIn.

She will ignore privacy rules and slide into their DMs with her premium recruiter account.

Not with a job offer. But with a sales pitch for a mandatory "Get Hired" course.

In no time she became the top performer in her firm. 

She is still sending me thank-you letters for being the mentor who changed her worldview.

Follow me for more financial advice.
