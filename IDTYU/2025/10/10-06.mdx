A girl making less than $100 a month on OF came to me for advice.

Her product was fine. (I was her beta-tester)

Her marketing was the problem. 

I don't think she understands

there's plenty of other girls posting dance videos online

And honestly, many of them are already doing it for free. 

I told her to change her target audience.

Stop selling to the entertained. Start selling to the invisible.

Find men on Twitter with anime profile pictures and fewer than 100 followers.

The ones who only post angry comments. That is her ICP.

Like one of their posts. Follow them.

Her brain short circuits. 

This man probably never gets any engagement from social media ever

When you like any of his post, he will get a notification

A flash of validation and recognition after years of yearning

Even better, that validation came from someone with a very sexy profile picture. 

He will click her profile and engage with her linktree.

She is thrilled by the consultation. 

Her revenue jumped to five figures after a few months doing this trick.

Her revenue traction made most startups trying to raise Series A look like a joke. 

She wasn't selling videos. She was selling the illusion of being seen.

Eventually, she quit her career. Pivoted to become a corporate recruiter.

She was failing. Until she remembered my lesson.

She stopped chasing top-tier candidates.

She started hunting the desperate graduates with "Open to Work" banners on LinkedIn.

She will ignore privacy rules and slide into their DMs with her premium recruiter account.

Not with a job offer. But with a sales pitch for a mandatory "Get Hired" course.

She weaponized the hope of a career to sell them a product.

Her colleagues were trying to fill roles. She was monetizing desperation.

In no time she became the top performer in her firm. 

She is still sending me thank-you letters for the consultation I gave for her past career. 

I didn't just give her a tactic. I was the mentor who changed her worldview.

Follow me for more financial advice.
