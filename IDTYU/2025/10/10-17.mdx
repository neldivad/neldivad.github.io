Im a record label owner. 

From TikTok, we see this kid who built a really good following. 

His songs are also vibing.

We DMed him. Told them who we are, then gave the kid a check for a million dollars.

He cried. His mother cried.

He thinks he's rich.

Calls up his friends and starts partying. 

I know this because he shares it all over TikTok. 

I dont think he understands. 

That check wasn't a gift.

It was a loan.

<!--truncate-->

The music video we shot for $200k? Debt.

The world-class producer, the mixing engineer, the tour bus?

All billed to his account.

And here's the best part.

I decide who he works with.

That world-class producer? He's a friend of mine.

His rates are astronomical.

The video director? My cousin. He charges a premium for "art."

I'm not just putting him in debt to the label.

I'm putting him in debt to my entire network.

His expenses are my friends' revenue.

He won't see a single royalty check. Ever.

I didn't sign an artist.

I launched a startup where the founder is personally liable for all operating costs.

A special purpose vehicle for me to pay my friends with his future earnings.

He's the star of the show, working for everyone else on his payroll, and still buying everyone the drinks.

He's not my partner.

He's my most profitable debtor.

Of course, he's gonna grow up and complain to me one day. 

I will let him out. 

But first, he has talk to that guy I know who stocks a lot of baby oil at his mansion.

Follow me for more financial advice.
