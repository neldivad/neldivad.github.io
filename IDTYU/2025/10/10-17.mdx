Im a humble record label owner with a few billion dollars of royalties under management.

From TikTok, we see this kid who built a really good following. His songs are also vibing.

We DMed him. Told them who we are, then gave him $1M. 

He cried. His mother cried. He thinks he's rich.

I dont think he understands. 

That check wasn't a gift. It was a loan.

<!--truncate-->

The music video we shot for $200k? Debt.

The world-class producer, the mixing engineer, the tour bus? All billed to his account.

Here's the best part. I decide who he works with.

That world-class producer? He is my friend. His rates are astronomical.

The video director? My cousin. He charges a premium for "art."

I'm not just putting him in debt to the label. I'm putting him in debt to my entire network.

My accountant will guarantee that he won't see a single royalty check. Ever.

I didn't sign an artist. I launched a startup where the founder is personally liable for all operating costs.

He's the star of the show, working for everyone else on his payroll, and still buying everyone the drinks.

He's gonna grow up and complain to me one day. 

I'm a generous guy. I will let him out. 

But first, he has talk to my friend who stocks a lot of baby oil at his mansion.
