I personally know an old founder who builds a business for 40 years.

His life's work. A legacy for his family.

He's tired. He wants to retire.

I have 30 years of experience in private equity, so he comes to me to sell.

He thinks I'm his successor.

I dont think he understands. 

I'm about to end this man's career. 

With dignity, of course.

First, I buy his company. A fair price. He leaves happy.

Then, the real work begins.

<!--truncate-->

The building he owned? It's now owned by a separate company I control.

The machinery? Same deal.

His company now owns nothing but a brand and a payroll.

Then, my new real estate company leases all those assets back to his old company.

At a very, very high price.

I call it "unlocking the value of fixed assets"

Suddenly, his profitable business is drowning in "operating expenses."

The profits that used to go to him, now come to me as lease payments.

In two years, the company declares bankruptcy.

The media calls it a tragedy.

The employees blame the economy.

They say the market just wasn't working out.

They are all right.

The market for their salaries wasn't working out.

And the market for my lease payments was working out perfectly.

Follow me for more financial advice.
