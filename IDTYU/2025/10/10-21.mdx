I was arguing with a entitled zoomer. 

Says life is tough for them. Can't afford house, kids. 

Then, he spends all money on avocado, Gucci, holidays, and OF

I don't think he understands. 

He thinks he's the first person to ever face a struggle.

I've been working 9-5 for a corporate. I drive 4 hours a day to get to my office 

For forty years, I didn't "work." I survived.

<!--truncate-->

My battlefield was a beige cubicle. My weapon was Microsoft Outlook.

My days were spent showing up to meetings and doing presentations for shareholders. 

He thinks all of those 20-page reports are going to write themselves?

Every day there's some office drama or politics I need to win. 

He thinks BCCing each of my managers is fun work?

This Zoomer doesn't get it. Clearing a competitor off the board is hard work.

Now he thinks I dont deserve my pension. That I'm bankrupting his generation.

He says my generation failed his. We failed at disciplining HIS generation

Don't get me started on real estate. I spent a decade of my life fixing toilets for a living. 

But that will be a story for another time.

## Context

Sad how zoomers will no longer get a fake email job in a white room unless they belong to a certain demographic. 

Debt-financed "opportunities" has brainwashed the entire civilization this is normal.
