I was arguing with a entitled zoomer. 

Says life is tough for them. Can't afford house, kids. 

Then they spend all money on avocado, Gucci, holidays, and OF

I don't think he understands. 

He thinks he's the first person to ever face a struggle.

He sees my corner office and my pension and feels entitled to it.

I've been working 9-5 for a corporate 

I drive 4 hours a day to get to my office 

For forty years, I didn't "work."

I survived.

He doesn't understand the war that was fought to win them.

My battlefield was a beige cubicle. My weapon was Microsoft Outlook.

My days were spent showing up to meetings and doing presentations for shareholders. 

You think all of those 20 page reports are going to write themselves?

Every day, I have 16 other colleagues trying to report my clock-in and clock-out hours to my manager. 

If I screw up, my desk goes to either one of them.

You think BCCing each of my managers is fun work?

Every day there's some office drama or politics I need to gain an upper hand from

My career-defining moment wasn't a product launch.

His project imploded. Then I took his job.

This Zoomer doesn't get it.

Now he thinks I dont deserve my pension. That I'm bankrupting his generation.

He says my generation failed his.

I dont think he understands. 

We failed at disciplining HIS generation

That's why he's poor, and that's why I'm winning.
