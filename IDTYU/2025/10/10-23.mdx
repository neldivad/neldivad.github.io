This other day, I was arguing with this Boomer in my comments.

He lectured me in my DMs. Told me I don't know what "hard work" is.

I dont think he understands.

<!--truncate-->

Seeing all of my other friends on Instagram having a vacation while I'm in Kumon is hard work. 

Preparing for unpaid internship and college applications is hard work. 

Boomer says I should be "learning new skills."

Harvard puts entire courses on YouTube for free. But I rather watch Instagram brainrots.

When I got to my job interview, recruiter gave me a stack of assignments. 

I gave it to chatGPT, told it to not make any mistakes, then went back scrolling TikTok. Recruiter ghosted me. 

A young founder gave me a job. Said he "believed in me."

9AM RTO was a huge red flag. He fired me after I was absent in the first week of job due to emotional anxiety.

Frustrated, I asked for career advice on X. Some guy wrote like, ten paragraphs.

Hello? TLDR. I just tagged Grok and asked, "is this true?"

I'm not trying to get ahead. I'm trying to get by.

Boomer thinks I'm the problem. The system is the problem.

So when is someone going to fix this?

## Context

As much as I feel bad for the younger generation, many of them are not raised well. 

Young women spending borrowed money like they gonna marry rich. 

Young men complaining and wasting 100% income on OF [^1]

[^1]: Yes, that's the limit. When you get the opportunity to work with an OF girl's, or a pop idol account, you see certain very irrational bids. People who are disenfranchised do spend as much as they can on a single pedestal for their attention.

Senior poverty is doubling every 10 years, and it is only certain that post-GenZ will be impoverished if they give up now, or try to follow the same book as previous generation. 

You save yourself by refusing the doomer narrative and choosing to believe you have the means to overcome the odds.
