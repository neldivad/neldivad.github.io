This other day, I was arguing with this Boomer in my comments.

He lectured me in my DMs.

Told me I don't know what "hard work" is.

You know whats hard? 

Seeing all of my other friends on Instagram having a vacation while I'm in Kumon.

My entire childhood was an unpaid internship for a college application.

Boomer says I should be "learning new skills."

I did. Harvard puts entire courses on YouTube for free.

But I rather watch the one on Instagram with subtitles.

Somehow, my algorithm is serving 4K 60fps of thirst traps.

The free market has spoken, so nothing wrong with engaging it a little.

When I got to my job interview, recruiter gave me a stack of assignments. 

I gave it to chatGPT, told it to not make any mistakes, then went back scrolling TikTok.

A young founder gave me a job. Said he "believed in me."

The mandatory 9 AM start time was a huge red flag.

I told him my contribution isn't measured in hours, but in vibes.

He fired me after I was absent in the first week of job due to emotional anxiety.

Frustrated, I asked for career advice on X.

Some guy wrote like, ten paragraphs.

Hello? TLDR.

I just tagged Grok and asked, "is this true?"

This Boomer says he sabotaged someone to get ahead.

I'm not trying to get ahead.

I'm trying to get by.

There's a difference.

He thinks I'm the problem.

The system is the problem.

He built a broken world and now he's mad I don't want to play.

So when is someone going to fix this?
