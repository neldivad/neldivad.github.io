I was stump with a problem I couldn't solve. 

If I have to pay a consultant for it, it would cost me millions. 

Then, I might not even guarantee I can solve it. 

My intern asked:

"Why not make it a take-home interview assignment?"

"The person who gets to solve it would get hired to the office to build it."

I had a flash of insight

My intern is a god damn genius. 

Unable to contain my excitement, I grabbed him by his head and started rubbing.

"Yoshi yoshi yoshi Yoshi yoshi..." 

Then, we posted a job ad for a "Lead Innovation Architect."

The final interview stage was a single task:

Solve our multi-million dollar problem.

Hundreds of applicants poured in.

Cumulative years of free labor.

Most of it was garbage. I ghosted all of them.

Then, a candidate from China submitted a solution.

It was elegant. Flawless. Brilliant.

My intern was thrilled. "Are we hiring him?"

I dont think he understand.

I dont have a problem anymore. 

Why would I add a new name to the payroll?

I made one call to HR.

Not to extend an offer.

But to flag the candidate's name.

"Ensure none of our competitors hire this person. Ever."

I thanked my intern for his service. 

Then, he is unemployed. 

You can't have the architect of the plan walking around.

Let's review the P&L.

A multi-million dollar problem, solved for $0.

A portfolio of other potential solutions for future use, acquired for $0.

A high-level competitor identified and preemptively neutralized.

And I saved $900 firing my intern.

That isn't a hack.

That is a talent acquisition strategy with 100% ROI.
