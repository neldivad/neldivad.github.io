My coworker complained that concert tickets were $200.

She said they used to be so much cheaper.

I just smiled.

I dont think she understanda.

The $200 ticket isn't the product.

It's the bait.

The moment tickets went on sale, my army of bots bought the entire inventory.

The operation is run by a HFT quant team I keep in Shanghai.

The tickets instantly reappear on the resale platform, which, of course, I'm heavily invested in.

Now the price is $500.

She's not paying the artist. She's paying me.

But that's not where the real genius is.

The real genius begins after she grits her teeth and clicks "Checkout."

The Service Fee.

The Venue Surcharge Fee.

The Digital Authentication Fee.

The Fee Fi Fo Fum Fee. 

The Fan Loyalty Processing Fee.

Each one is a separate, calculated paper cut.

Too small to make her abandon the cart.

Just big enough to bleed her devotion dry.

I didn't just corner the market on tickets.

I cornered the market on her desire, then taxed it multiple different ways.

She thinks she's a fan.

She's my most reliable, emotionally-driven passive income.
