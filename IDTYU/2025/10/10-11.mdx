I own a software company that hits a growth wall recently. 

We had a problem. Its my biggest competitor.

Their engineers were too good.

And they were having fun.

Their team was lean, fast, and happy.

They shipped product while my teams debated story points.

This wasn't just a business threat.

It was a personal insult to my entire methodology.

My board of directors told me we should pivot. Make a better product. 

I dont think they understand.

<!--truncate-->

You don't fight a lean team with a better product.

You fight them with process.

So I designed a "masterclass" for their leadership.

The "Six-Sigma Jujutsu Kaizen Framework for Elite Engineering."

It sounded expensive. It was.

I taught them the art of the pre-planning meeting.

The necessity of the post-sprint retrospective-debrief.

The gospel of assigning story points to bathroom breaks.

Then I showed it off in a tech conference. 

Everyone loved it. 

I get calls from other people, asking me to be their consultant. 

All according to plan. 

In just 2 months, their best engineers, the ones who lived to code, were now drowning in Jira.

Their Slack channels, once filled with technical debate, were now battlegrounds over the definition of "done."

Their velocity charts looked incredible.

But their product development ground to a halt.

Meanwhile, I still get paid a hefty six-figure fee.

I didn't just neutralize my competition.

I made them pay me to inject their company with a terminal case of corporate sclerosis.

They thought they were buying an advantage.

I sold them a virus disguised as a framework.

Follow me for more financial advice.
