Knowledge is power.

Thats why I have a thousand subscribers who pay me $500 a month for my private newsletter.

Every day, I stream complex trading strategies on my terminal. 

I also have Claude Code running 10 different agents in the background. 

All querying prices from Yahoo Finance.

There's like 10 different lines in my charts. 

Ichimoku clouds, Boku no pico bands, Jujutsu kaizen VWAP.

They think they are a monkey if they dont get it.

So they all engage in my Discord, talking about liquidity, Futanari inflation, and getting promoted by my bot.

I dont think they understand

They think they're buying financial alpha.

They are actually buying a very expensive sedative.

They spend hours every week consuming my "growth hacks", "market analysis", "AI proomps"

They feel intelligent, informed, and prepared for battle.

They learn the 10 mistakes every founder makes.

They memorize the 7 secrets to 10x returns.

The information is so compelling it paralyzes them.

They're so afraid of making one of those 10 mistakes that they never start.

They're so busy waiting for the perfect moment to deploy my 7 secrets that they never act.

A customer who gets rich from my advice might unsubscribe.

But a customer trapped in a loop of learning? 

Forever preparing for a game he's too scared to play? 

He is a customer for life.

My genius wasn't building a system to make them rich.

It was building a system that converts their fear of failure into my recurring revenue.

Follow me for more financial advice.
