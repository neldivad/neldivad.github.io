In places like LinkedIn and newspaper, they always tell you to hire "A-Players."

To fill your ranks with people smarter than you.

It's a lovely sentiment.

It's also how you lose your empire.

My new head of HR just landed a superstar.

A true killer from a top competitor.

She was ecstatic.

So I fired her.

She didn't understand her real job.

She thought she was hired to find talent.

She was hired to protect MY culture.

<!--truncate-->

My culture is a perfectly balanced ecosystem of B-players.

They are competent, predictable, and loyal.

They are loyal because they know, deep down, they couldn't do better elsewhere.

This makes them very, very manageable.

This new "A-Player" is a virus.

He will question processes. He will outperform his peers.

He will make my loyal B-players feel inadequate, anxious, and ambitious.

He will introduce the idea that there is something better.

He is a threat to my stability.

The recruiter didn't just hire an employee.

She opened the gate and let in a Trojan horse.

She was supposed to be my friend, tasked with guarding the walls.

But she mistook an enemy for a gift.

They say to keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.

The recruiter failed to identify the enemy.

So I made her one. And now she's nowhere near.

Follow me for more financial advice.
