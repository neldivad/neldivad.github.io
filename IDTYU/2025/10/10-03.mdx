I saw a parent outraged by her son's teacher. 

"I don't think maths is your thing.", the teacher told the son. 

The mother complained the teacher was giving her son an excuse to stop trying.

That he was undermining the child's belief in himself.

That he was failing the next generation.

I dont think she understands.

She's absolutely right.

And it's the most powerful weapon in my arsenal.

You see, I don't tell my competitors they are going to lose.

That would inspire them to fight.

And I dont like to take chances.

Instead, I plant a seed of doubt.

I buy them a drink at a conference and say:

"This market is brutal. I'm not sure your model is built for the long haul."

"Have you considered a strategic acquisition? It's a respectable exit."

I tell them their failure isn't their fault, it's just the 'macro environment.'

I give them an elegant, intellectual excuse to give up.

I am the teacher, calmly explaining why maths isn't their thing.

They don't fail because I crushed them.

They fail because I convinced them they were never meant to succeed.

Their ambition dies not with a bang, but with a quiet, reasonable whisper in their own head.

The mother asked, "Where will the next generation of builders come from?"

They will come from me.

Because I'm making sure no one else believes they have what it takes.

Follow me for more financial advice.
