I am a humble fund manager with only a few billion dollars of assets under management. 

I tell every founder I invest in the same thing.

Hire aggressively. Scale your team. Growth is everything.

I also give them very specific hiring mandates.

Strict quotas for different people with different quirks.

They must be met, or they violate the terms of my investment.

People call me a progressive visionary.

They write articles about my commitment to social fairness, justice.

I dont think they understand.

While their headcount doubles, my own core team remains lean.

While they celebrate their new hire with a weird quirk, I'm poaching their one competent engineer.

The mandate isn't to hire the *best* candidates.

It's just to hit the numbers.

So they fill their ranks with mediocrity to stay compliant.

Now, their company is bloated with corporate drama. 

Their employees politicking for promotions. 

Juniors scrambling to find the clock-in and clock-out times of their competition.

Productivity plummets. Meetings multiply. 

The culture fractures into a dozen warring tribes.

Their burn rate skyrockets while their product stagnates.

This isn't an investment strategy.

It's corporate warfare.

They think I'm funding them.

I'm executing a denial-of-service attack, flooding their system with human malware until it crashes.

The next few decades will be exceptionally quiet. 

And exceptionally profitable. 

Follow me for more financial advice.
