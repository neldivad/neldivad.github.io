19 yo founder is losing money on a dating app he founded. 

His marketing team says their mission is to help people find "the one."

I dont think he understands. 

When their customers find "the one". They delete the app.

A successful connection is a lost customer. It's a two-person churn event.

My two greatest enemies are love and happiness.

His summer intern didn't understand this. He noticed a user who hadn't had a match in six months.

Feeling clever, he tweaked the algorithm to give him a "boost."

He got a match. Went on a date. Fell in love. My intern celebrated it as a success.

I congratulated him. Then, he is unemployed. 

The intern thought his job was to create couples. His job was to create retention.

The app isn't a search engine for love. It's a slot machine for loneliness.

Every swipe is a pull of the lever. The occasional match is just enough of a win to keep you playing.

Frustration is what drives our in-app purchases.

'Likes' and 'Boosts' are not tools for success. They are taxes on desperation.

We don't sell relationships. We monetize the hunt.

Until the founder pivots their monetization strategy, I am short this company.
