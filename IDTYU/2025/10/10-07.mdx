I was called into the board meeting of a startup. 

It was a dating app made by a young founder trying to get laid. 

His marketing team says their mission is to help people find "the one."

They put it on coffee mugs. Advertise love on their T-shirts.

I dont think they get it.

When their customers find "the one"...

They delete the app.

A successful connection is a lost customer.

It's a two-person churn event.

My two greatest enemies are love and happiness.

My summer intern didn't understand this.

He noticed a user who hadn't had a match in six months.

Feeling clever, he tweaked the algorithm to give him a "boost."

He got a match. Went on a date. Fell in love.

My intern celebrated it as a success.

I ordered the CEO to fire him.

The intern thought his job was to create couples.

His job was to create retention.

The app isn't a search engine for love.

It's a slot machine for loneliness.

Every swipe is a pull of the lever.

The occasional match is just enough of a win to keep you playing.

Frustration is what drives our in-app purchases.

'Likes' and 'Boosts' are not tools for success.

They are taxes on desperation.

We don't sell relationships. We monetize the hunt.

Until the founder pivots their monetization strategy, I am short this company.
