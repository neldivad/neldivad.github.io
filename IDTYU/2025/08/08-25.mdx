They cry about the WNBA losing $30 million a year.

They argue about viewership and pay gaps. They are trying to fix the product.

I dont think they understand.

<!--truncate-->

When the product isn't selling, you don't change the product. You change the business.

Someone threw a dildo on the court during a game.

The media called it a disgrace. That's the single most valuable data point the league has ever generated.

It was a moment of pure, unmonetized audience engagement.

The solution is not to stop them. The solution is to charge them.

Stop selling courtside seats. Start auctioning "Disruption Rights."

One slot per quarter, sold to the highest bidder.

The winner gets an officially branded projectile and a 10-second window to make their mark on national television.

You are not selling basketball. You're selling a stake in the spectacle.

The WNBA stops being an unprofitable sports league. It becomes a highly profitable platform for monetized chaos.
