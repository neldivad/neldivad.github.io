My competitors obsess over their supply chain.

They lose sleep over their CAC. They pay $100k to create ads with 1.2 ROAS.

I dont think they understand. 

<!--truncate-->

I manufacture a product of deliberately average quality. I sell it at a premium price. 

I hold no inventory. I spend $0 on advertising. And my profits are swelling like the thing under me.

How??

I don't sell to customers. I sell the dream of a business to bored housewives and men who hate their jobs.

They aren't buying a lotion or a health shake.

They are buying a LARP kit for being an entrepreneur.

I don't hire salespeople. I recruit "partners."

They pay me for a starter kit and the privilege of selling my goods.

They become my sales team, my marketing department, and my customer service reps.

I created a reverse funnel (that looks like a pyramid)

Instead of pushing a product down to a market. I pull aspiring entrepreneurs up into a system.

A system where the primary product being sold is the opportunity to sell the product.

My COGS isn't the raw material in a factory. 

It's the cost of producing slick training videos and emotionally manipulative seminars. [^1]

I'm not in the business of manufacturing goods. I am in the business of manufacturing hope.

Follow me for more financial advice.
