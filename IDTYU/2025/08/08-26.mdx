I was at college the other day, looking for a new girlfriend. 

<!--truncate-->

I see many women who do the same make up, looking like their idols. 

Men also doing the same. The have the same brocolli haircut.

They are beautiful, generic people who like the same basic things. 

Football. Coldplay. Labubu. Stanley cup. Vacations to Japan.

They've perfected the art of being universally appealing.

And they are almost always alone.

I dont think they understand. 

When you try to sell to everyone, you sell to no one.

Mass appeal creates a bystander effect.

Every potential suitor sees a perfect product with high demand. 

They assume it's already off the market. So they don't even bother to make a bid. [^1]

Now, look at the strange ones.

The Goth, the artist, the one with 177013 on his shirt.

They are not advertising to the masses. They are actively repelling them.

This isn't cringe. It's a high-precision, niche marketing strategy.

By broadcasting a signal that 99% of the market finds unappealing, they create a powerful filter. 

The only person who approaches them is their ICP.

That person doesn't see competition. They see a product made exclusively for them.

The barrier to entry feels low, so they make the approach. It's the most efficient lead generation funnel in existence.

The beautiful person is paying a high advertising cost for zero conversions.

The cringe person pays nothing and captures 100% of their target market.

Don't build a brand for the crowd. Build a monopoly of one.

[^1]: You be surprised how many people who looked perfect have a lot of trouble getting a date. When asked in the late game how did they stay single for so long, its because everyone assumed they were taken. Shoot your shot.
