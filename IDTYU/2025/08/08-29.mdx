My competitor blew $10M worth of marketing with nothing to show.

<!--truncate-->

They blame the market taste. They blame Taylor Swift's marriage stealing views.

They think it's their "content." They think they published at the wrong time.

I don't think they understand. 

Making organic and new content is exactly how they wasted $10M.

Me? I find the biggest account.

They usually say dumb stuff that gets everyone mad, look very weird and, or are shaking their half-naked butt.

Then I "engage" with it. I do this for every half-naked woman's post before they go viral.

People think I lost my mind. They think I should do it anonymously because they are "ashamed."

I don't think they understand.

When I engage with a half-naked woman's post, it's not because I'm beta-testing her digital product at work.

Those comments, reposts, and remixes? They are my seed capital.

If one of them blows up, I blow up too.

The best part? Everyone finds me in the comments section. I become their "top fan."

Suddenly, I get a lot of traffic to my own website. Without making a single ad.

TFW someone else worked hard on shaking their butt, while I free-ride their content.

## Context 
Its already a well documented bot strategy for egirls to follow big streamers Twitter, and post their sexy photos as soon as the streamer makes a post.

Crypto bots also do the same trick for big financial accounts. 

If you have less than 1k followers on Twitter, a majority of your impressions will come from replies due to how the algo works. 

Instead of trying to be a shark in the sea, be a remora and leech from a big shark. [Gary Vee even had his own $1.80 rule.](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/instagram-for-business-180-strategy-grow-business-brand/)
