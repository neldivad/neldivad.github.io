My friend's dating and rent-to-own girlfriend funnel was underperforming.

<!--truncate-->

He was paying exorbitant fees to matchmakers. They kept bringing him depreciating assets and unattractive clients.

It was a classic case of misaligned incentives.

I dont think he understand.

Cash is a lazy motivator. It rewards the transaction, not the outcome. [^1]

So I tore up their commission structure. 

The new performance bonus for a successful match is no longer money -- It's equity.

The matchmaker's commission? Participation in the consummation of the deal. 

A threesome. [^2]

Suddenly, his deal flow became highly curated. The quality of the candidates became exceptional.

Why? Because the matchmakers were no longer salespeople.

They were angel investors, vetting a startup they would have to personally merge with.

They had skin in the game. The most intimate skin imaginable.

This isn't about dating.

It's about creating a closed-loop system of accountability where your employee's primal self-interest is inextricably linked to your own.

I didn't just optimize his pipeline. I vertically integrated his supply chain.

[^1]: And thats why matchmaking services never worked. The incentive is already wrong to begin with. And love is more than just a transaction you can outsource to someone. 

[^2]: Actually happens in some idol scouting process. The part of explicit acts being promised after closing.
