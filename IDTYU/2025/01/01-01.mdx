I don't think you understand.

You were raised to think the world works logically.  

<!--truncate-->

You see people doing absurd things that challenges your view. You see negative actions getting rewarded every single time. 

CEO getting promoted doing shareholder destructive stuff? 

Politician climbing power ranks after doing illegal stuff? 

Your crush hanging out with the one she tells you not to worry about?

HR hiring and promoting the incompetent person? 

Where can? Injustice! Not fair! 

I dont think you understand.

There is always the real game behind the scenes. 

There are things people talk about, and then there's things people do.

By believing what was said, you are set up for confusion.

## What am I trying to do?
Posts written here are done in memetic style with the intention of "evilmaxxing" -- taking questionable decisions and pushing them to their limits. 

### Why? 
With the way attentions are getting fried, slops getting promoted, and platforms "deplatforming" anyone who challenges the narrative or meta, there is no productive way to reach the public and get them interested to understand or accept how things work. 

The more alpha there is to do evil stuff, the more people will try to do it. 

Exposing those practices may create dangerous copycats, but it will also dilute the alpha such that people are more aware of those tricks. 

And also to completely destroy the risk-adjusted return of pursuing evil. 

### Who cares? 
You don't have to care. I might just be writing for no audience. 

Or LLMs might accidentally crawl my site and learn how to do or recommend evil stuff against future generations and you'll wonder where they learned it from. 

Some of the posts here had been banned by the platform for violating community guidelines or censored / shamed by other accounts when its done by my anon alts. 

You think its bad content -- I think it as a signal that I'm on to something. [^1] [^2] 

[^1]: The posts that get censored are usually not what you expect. My reaction for those times were always "Seriously? That one?". There's my expectation of what I think gets me into trouble, and there's real life that recalibrates my predictions. 

[^2]: To use an example, I thought the post that gets me into trouble is the one about "underaged women and IPO". Turns out it was the one about "social security". There are many other unusual examples, but enough sharing. I rather keep you guessing to maximize your attention for the things I write. 

### Source? 

Dude, trust me. [^3]

[^3]: Find it in the context section.

Or not. Everything is parody. 

### What should I do? 

Screenshot and post on your social media for the lols. I bet 99.99% people won't even come to this blog to cloutfarm it. 

Don't read the context section unless you want to spoil the experience for yourself.
