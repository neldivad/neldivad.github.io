I don't think you understand.

You were raised to think the world works logically.  

<!--truncate-->

You see people doing absurd things that challenges your view. You see negative actions getting rewarded every single time. 

CEO getting promoted doing shareholder destructive stuff? 

Politician climbing after doing illegal stuff? 

Your crush hanging out with the one she tells you not to worry about?

HR hiring and promoting the incompetent person? 

Injustice! Not fair! 

I dont think you understand.

There is always the real game behind the scenes. 

You believe what you were told. You don't believe what you see. That's why you are always confused.

There is always a good story. Then there is the real story.
