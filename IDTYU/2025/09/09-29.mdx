Im a humble fund manager with only a few trillion dollars of asset under management.

I dont call any shots, so they call me a passive investor.

My mission is simple: offer the market, to the market.

I use complex algorithms to value and cap-weight every major asset.

My fund is a perfect mirror of the global economy.

Because the strategy is so brain dead, our fees are as micro soft as the thing under me.

We pass the savings on to our customers.

They think we are rightfully rewarded for providing liquidity.

A noble, boring, public good.

That's the story we tell everyone.

I dont think they understand.

When you control trillions of dollars, you are anything but passive.

You don't track the market.

You are the market.

You become the largest shareholder in every meaningful corporation on earth.

This means you are even more powerful than the owners of the company.

The CEO saying something you don't like?

You don't need to argue.

You don't even need him to show up to your Zoom call talking about PIP (performance improvement plan).

You just install a new one at the next annual shareholder meeting.

Call it "ensuring proper governance."

Soon, every company only has MY loyalist.

Sure, sometimes the CEOs make bad business decision listening to my suggestion. 

I dont think people understand.

I literally don't need to care about profits or returns.

Its not even my money.

The real genius isn't in the returns. It's in the access.

My friends need to get paid.

So I set up a boutique consulting firm specializing in "compliance" and "professional requirements" we invented.

They charge obscene fees for PowerPoints.

Every CEO gets a call.

They are strongly advised to hire this firm.

They know it's a shakedown.

But they also know who signs off on their eight-figure bonus.

Some call it a tax that I levy on the entire economy.

Stop overreacting. Its called professional service.

Everyone thinks Im managing a utility company.

Im literally a government with a ticker symbol.

Follow me for more financial advice.
