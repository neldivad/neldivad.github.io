They say the modern man is lost.

Drifting without purpose, scrolling on TikTok and OF for a lifeline.

My competitors see them as a failed demographic.

I dont think they understand.

I see them as an untapped natural resource.

And I built a system to give them hope.

How? 

It starts with a simple DM.

Usually from a very attractive woman who believes in their hidden potential.

She's an AI, of course.

But her faith in him is real enough to make him click.

She guides him to a paid course on "disruptive investing."

And then, into an exclusive Discord channel.

He thinks he's found a tribe.

So...what do you call a group of monkeys?

Anyway, my team has already identified a target.

A forgotten, low-float stock I bought for pennies weeks ago.

My bots begin seeding rumors on Reddit and Twitter.

The hype builds into a low hum.

Then, the signal drops in the Discord.

"Guys, I'm hearing HUGE news about $XYZ."

My army of Reddit and Twitter bots amplifies the chatter into a roar.

FOMO spreads faster than a plague.

The "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity.

A tidal wave of buy orders floods the market from thousands of desperate men.

They think they're on a rocket ship to the moon.

Their frantic buying creates the price spike.

The beautiful, dramatic spike that allows me to sell my entire position at the peak.

I don't need Wall Street.

I have a private army of true believers.

I didn't scam them.

I provided a high-stakes, real-time educational seminar on supply and demand.

I also sold them a dream and a purpose for a few days.

Their life savings was the tuition.

I'm just getting paid to be their professor.

I showed them how to LARP as investors.

But they were actors for my exit liquidity.
