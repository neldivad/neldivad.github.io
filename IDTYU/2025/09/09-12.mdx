They say the modern man is lost.

Drifting without purpose, scrolling on TikTok and OF for a lifeline.

I dont think they understand.

I see them as an untapped natural resource. And I built a system to give them hope.

How? 

It starts with a simple DM. Usually from a very attractive woman who believes in their hidden potential.

She's an AI, of course. But her faith in him is real enough to make him click.

She guides him to a paid course on "disruptive investing." Then, into an exclusive Discord channel.

We share a forgotten, low-float stock I bought for pennies weeks ago.

My bots begin seeding rumors on Reddit and Twitter. Then, the signal drops in the Discord.

"Guys, I'm hearing HUGE news about $XYZ."

My army of Reddit and Twitter bots amplifies the chatter into a roar.

FOMO spreads faster than a plague. The "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity.

A tidal wave of buy orders floods the market from thousands of desperate men.

They think they're on a rocket ship to the moon. Their price spike allows me to sell my entire position at the peak.

I didn't scam them. I also sold them a dream and a purpose for a few days.

Their life savings was the tuition. I'm just getting paid to be their professor.

I showed them how to LARP as investors. But they were actors for my exit liquidity.

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context

Oldest trick in the book, but you still see this happening in crypto and unproductive asset speculations. 

Volatility in low float stocks is not something to chase. 

When someone owns a large part of the company, it doesn't take a lot of capital to engineer a big price spike. 

The high volatility will trigger many trading alerts and amateurs will buy into the market. 

As long as the owner doesn't dump faster than the market, the price will rise -- thats what it meant by exit liquidity.

Suppose the market doesn't buy? Or that the owner himself bought at the top? 

He doesn't lose much. He is already owning the company he wants. He just wants to exit at a better price.
