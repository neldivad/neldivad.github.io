A female colleague was complaining about her dating life.

She was ignored by HINW men she wanted to be married with. 

And her DMs are full of unemployed losers with dank pickup lines.

I dont think she understands. 

You don't apply for a merger. You engineer a hostile takeover.

Her new hunting ground? The mobile pickup shelf at the lunch spot of Sweetgreens.

This isn't a food rack. It's an unsecured server of her target demographic.

The instructions were simple. Find an order with a man's name. Take it.

She's not stealing a $15 salad. She's creating an inefficiency in his day that only she can resolve.

An hour later, she finds him on LinkedIn. The name on the bag is the unique identifier.

"I think I accidentally took your lunch. I feel terrible. Let me make it up to you and buy you dinner."

She manufactured a crisis. Then positioned herself as the exclusive solution.

It's a cold call with a 100% open rate, bypassing all gatekeepers.

Stop swiping. Start creating targeted supply chain disruptions.
