Just the other day, I was about to tip someone $100. 

The man behind the counter was defeated. He asked me if I wanted fries with that.

I looked him in the eye. "Just put them in the bag bro."

I watched the last flicker of light in his soul die.

As I was leaving, I leaned in. "Do you think the rich should be taxed more?"

I told him I'm running for office. On an 'Eat the Rich' platform. He looked at me like I was a god.

"Yesss bro"

"Then don't forget to vote for me."

I dont think he understands.

Who do you think sponsors my "Eat the Rich" campaign?

They are my friends. I'm sponsored by them.

Eat the rich? I only eat the rich I don't like.

Every rally fuels the fire. Then my law firm drafts the new, impossibly complex tax code. 

Loopholes for my friends, death traps for my enemies. 

I also get to make entertainment and court drama for public spectacle. At the taxpayers expense.

He's worried about his mortgage. I own the fund that owns his mortgage.

When enough of his friends vote for me, even the rich fear me. 

They will sponsor me to get on my good side. Give my children a cushy good job. 

When that happens, why do I need money? When I have power? Fame? Job security? Children who will never fail?

And people around me putting the fries in the bag when I tell them to?

The $100 tip? I changed my mind after I got his vote.

## Context

The higher you go, its all the same people. 

You find them as soon as you understand what they were really after. 

Most capitalists preach capitalism, but if they are deep into politics,its really just socialism with capitalist accounting. 

Just don't trust bureaucracies to have public's interest in general.
