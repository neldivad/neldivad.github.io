Just the other day, I was about to tip someone $100. 

The man behind the counter was defeated.

He asked if I wanted fries with that.

I looked him in the eye.

"Just put them in the bag bro."

I watched the last flicker of light in his soul die.

Clearly, he has heard this countless times from other customers. 

As I was leaving, I leaned in.

"Do you think the rich should be taxed more?"

His eyes lit up with hope.

I told him I'm running for office.

On an 'Eat the Rich' platform.

He looked at me like I was a god.

"Yesss bro"

"Then don't forget to vote for me. "

I dont think he understands.

Who do you think sponsors my "Eat the Rich" campaign?

Who do you think are those rich people who told him to put the fries in the bag every day?

They are my friends. 

I'm sponsored by them.

Eat the rich?

I only eat the rich I don't like

Every rally, every outraged news segment, fuels the fire.

Then my law firm drafts the new, impossibly complex tax code.

A labyrinth of loopholes for my friends, and a death trap for my enemies.

All passed with the thunderous applause of the masses.

The public's anger funds my campaign.

My campaign creates new laws.

Then, my firm charges a fortune to navigate those laws.

Every day, we get to produce media entertainment and court drama for public spectacle.

At the taxpayers expense.

He's worried about his mortgage.

I own the fund that owns his mortgage.

He thinks I'm fighting for him.

I'm just upgrading the architecture of his prison.

When enough of his friends vote for me, even the rich fear me. 

They will sponsor me to get on my good side. 

Give my children a cushy good job. 

When that happens, why do I need money?

When I have power? Fame? Job security? Children who will never fail?

And people around me putting the fries in the bag when I tell them to?

Follow me for more financial advice.
