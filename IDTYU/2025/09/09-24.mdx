I was Netflix and chilling with one of my girlfriends. 

She asked for her allowance. I sent her $2000.

She thinks it's a generous gift.

I think of it as a customer retention cost.

I dont think she understands.

The same Federal Reserve that prints her allowance is also devaluing it the moment it hits her account.

Every dollar she saves is a melting ice cube.

But my assets are inflation-proof. They're the very things that inflate.

The Central Bank isn't my enemy -- it's my largest, most reliable business partner.

Every time they print money or lower the interest rates, my portfolio swells like the thing under me.

You call it currency devaluation. I call it compound interest. Passive income.  

This isn't a relationship. It's a perfect, self-sustaining economic loop.

Soon, other girls who felt the economic pressure will also want to go out with me, making me a sigma Chad. 

My dating pool isn't getting better.

The market is just getting worse for them.

The guy who bullied me in high school?

He's asking me if I want fries with that. 

I dont think he understands.

He's worried about his mortgage.

I own the fund that holds his mortgage.

He's not just stuck in a job -- he's paying me rent to live in his own life.

His money, his wife, his life? 

All mine. 

And I'm not going to stop. 

You don't get rich fighting the system.

You become the system they can't fight.
