I was Netflix and chilling with one of my girlfriends. 

She asked for her allowance. I sent her $2000.

She thinks it's a generous gift. She starts dancing on Tiktok with all the happiness. 

I dont think she understands.

<!--truncate-->

The same Federal Reserve that prints her allowance is also devaluing it the moment it hits her account.

Every dollar she saves is a melting ice cube.

But my assets are inflation-proof. The money printer is my largest, most reliable business partner.

Every time they print money or lower the interest rates, my portfolio swells like the thing under me.

You call it currency devaluation. I call it compound interest. Passive income.  

Soon, other girls who felt the economic pressure will also want to go out with me. 

I grow older, my girlfriends get younger. 

I become a sigma Chad by doing absolutely nothing.

The guy who bullied me in high school? He's asking me if I want fries with that. 

I dont think he understands.

He's worried about his mortgage. I own the fund that holds his mortgage.

He's not just stuck in a job -- he's paying me rent to live in his own life.

His money, his wife, his life? 

All mine. And I'm not going to stop. 

You don't get rich fighting the system. You become the system they can't fight.

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context

Wake up, wagie. 

There's a reason why you aren't having kids at 35. 

There's a reason why its impossible to date before 30 as a man. 

There's a reason why all of the women in your cohort is hanging out with older men. 

There's a reason why 10% of women is doing OnlyFans. 

You seriously think we all thought we did it for the fun of it?
