19 yo entrepreneur just raised $2M for his startup last week. 

Everyone claps. 

Everyone loves a story of a good entrepreneur.

The lone wolf who builds an empire from scratch.

It's a romantic story.

I dont think people understand.

That 19 yo? 90% chance he will fail and go homeless. 

That's because I've seen the news so much it gets old.

The entrepreneur is a street performer with an LLC.

He juggles VCs, customers, and payroll.

He dances for a different dollar, hoping one of them makes him a millionaire.

It's a high-risk, high-effort, low-probability bet on his own genius.

And his bet almost never works out because he is so full of himself. 

<!--truncate-->

You see him failing in public everyday.

I, on the other hand, am a salaried employee.

You think that means I'm a cog. A coward.

I dont think you understand. 

It means I have a single, captive client with infinite money -- especially if its a government.

The founder or taxpayers takes all the risk.

I take a salary.

If the company fails, the founder loses his house. Taxpayers loses their retirement.

I get a severance package.

If the company succeeds, everyone gets rich.

My stock options are a tax on his success, with none of the downside.

He built the ship so he could be captain.

I let him build it, then convinced the owners I'd be a better captain.

Now he reports to me.

He's the visionary who started the feast.

I'm the executive who gets the biggest steak for simply showing up.

Lesson? 

Stop selling to so many customers. 

You only need to sell yourself to one.
