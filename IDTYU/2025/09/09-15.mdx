90% of traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days.

Most brokerages see this as a tragedy.

I dont think they understand.

I see it as a colossal failure of imagination.

My platform is an engine of confusion, disguised as insight.

We send thousands of "trading signals" every day.

Buy oil. Sell tech. Short the index. Go long on crypto.

The goal isn't to be right. It's to make them act.

Every time they take a position, we take the opposite.

They bet on red, I put my chip on black. The house always has an edge.

Their loss isn't a byproduct of the market.

It is my primary revenue stream.

But the 90/90/90 rule presented a bottleneck.

When a client's account hits zero, my revenue stream stops.

A dead golden goose lays no eggs.

So I introduced our most innovative feature.

The Loyalty Credit Line.

Some people might call it "letting them go into massive debt."

I call it "extending their market participation runway."

When their balance hits zero, we don't close their account.

We invest in them.

We give them the margin to keep trading. 

To keep losing.

Their debt becomes my highest-performing asset.

I haven't just created a brokerage.

I've created a perpetual motion machine of loss that powers my profit.

I've turned a customer into an annuity.

Follow me for more financial advice.
