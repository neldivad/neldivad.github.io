It's Valentines day. My girlfriend wanted flowers.

But every florist was sold out. 

Amateurs complain about surge pricing. 

An artificial scarcity designed to prey on the desperate.

They see it as a problem.

I dont think they understand.

Its a pathetic business model. A market inefficiency begging for a correction.

Why? 

Because I know a place with a permanent, motivated supplier base.

The cemetery.

Grief is a powerful motivator for consumption.

The bereaved are not price-sensitive.

They over-supply the market with high-quality, fresh inventory daily.

So I went there and'acquired' the most vibrant assets from plots with the oldest dates.

Minimal chance of immediate family noticing the 'liquidation event'.

Then I walked back to the main street.

I found a dozen panicked men, facing relationship audits they were about to fail.

I offered them a solution. For a price.

I wasn't just selling flowers.

I was a market maker.

I took an illiquid, sentimental asset...

...and reintroduced it into a high-demand, hyper-liquid one.

I created liquidity where there was only sorrow.

My girlfriend got her flowers.

And the profit margin paid for dinner.

Follow me for more financial advice.
