It's Valentines day. My girlfriend wanted flowers.

But every florist was sold out.  Amateurs complain about surge pricing on flowers. 

I dont think they understand.

I know exactly a place with a permanent, motivated supplier base. 

The cemetery.

<!--truncate-->

Grief is a powerful motivator for consumption. The bereaved are not price-sensitive.

They over-supply the market with high-quality, fresh inventory daily.

So I went there and'acquired' the most vibrant assets from plots with the oldest dates.

Then I walked back to the main street. I found a dozen panicked men, facing relationship audits they were about to fail.

I offered them a solution. For a price.

I wasn't just selling flowers. I was a market maker.

I created liquidity where there was only sorrow.

My girlfriend got her flowers. And the profit margin paid for dinner.

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context

I met a psycho who actually did that and I thought he was too smart. 

I haven't find out what happened to his relationships after. Maybe I'll share more after I got invited / not invited to his wedding.
