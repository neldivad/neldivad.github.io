The owner of my local gym was drowning in sentiment and debt.

<!--truncate-->

He loved his "community."

I dont think he understands -- His "community" was bankrupting him.

So I bought his gym for pennies on the dollar.

He thought I'd add new machines -- I didn't add a single thing.

I brought in a bulldozer and tore out the basketball court. His staff was horrified.

They saw a feature. I saw a filter.

You see, a basketball court attracts a certain demographic -- High-usage, low-spend, zero secondary revenue.

They weren't customers -- they were liabilities.

By removing their reason to be there, I removed them.

Suddenly, the gym was quiet and clean. Then I doubled the membership price.

And the real customers started to arrive.

They weren't paying for the equipment. They were paying to not be at a gym with the people who used the basketball court.

I didn't sell fitness. I sold exclusivity as a service.

Profit isn't about what you add. It's about who you have the courage to subtract.

Follow me for more financial advice.
