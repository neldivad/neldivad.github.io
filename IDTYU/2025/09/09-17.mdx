They say you should cast a wide net to find the best talent.

We agree.

That's why our job postings are always public.

And then everyone clapped. 

I don't think they understand.

The public part is the product, not the process.

The decision was made weeks ago.

The position was always going to my client's daughter.

She's not qualified, but her father's contract is worth nine figures.

That's what I call "qualified."

But compliance requires a "fair" hiring process.

Its a little bit annoying, but we have to put on a show.

We post the job on every platform.

Our system invites hundreds to "audition."

We make them complete multi-stage projects.

We make them present their "vision" to a panel of executives.

I dont think they understand.

We have no intention of hiring them.

We're simply generating market intelligence at their expense.

And honestly, it's fantastic entertainment.

Watching people dance for a job that was never theirs is the best free content in the world.

Every presentation is a window into our competitors' strategies.

Every desperate pitch is a lesson in what the market values.

Once in a while, a true gem emerges.

Someone brilliant.

We don't hire them.

We add them to a list and monitor their career elsewhere.

I'm like the LV100 boss making sure that LV1 hero doesn't get fed.

This isn't a hiring pipeline.

It's a human intelligence operation disguised as an HR department.

We maintain the illusion of meritocracy to protect the reality of our aristocracy.

Follow me for more financial advice.
