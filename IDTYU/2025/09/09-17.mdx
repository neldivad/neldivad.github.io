I'm hiring. $300k per year. 

We think hiring should be transparent, that's why our job postings are always public. Everyone claps. 

I don't think they understand.

The public part is the product, not the process.

The decision was made weeks ago. The position was always going to my client's daughter.

She's not qualified, but her father's contract is worth nine figures. That's what I call "qualified."

But compliance requires a "fair" hiring process, so we have to put on a show.

We post the job on every platform. Our system invites hundreds to "audition."

We have no intention of hiring them. We're simply generating market intelligence at their expense.

And honestly, it's fantastic entertainment.

Watching people dance for a job that was never theirs is the best free content in the world.

Every presentation is a window into our competitors' strategies. 

Once in a while, a true gem emerges. Someone brilliant.

We don't hire them. We add them to a list and monitor their career elsewhere.

I'm like the LV100 boss making sure that LV1 hero doesn't get fed.

This isn't a hiring pipeline. It's a human intelligence operation disguised as an HR department.

We maintain the illusion of meritocracy to protect the reality of our aristocracy.

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context 

A single job ad costs $200-2000 per month depending on platform and role. [^1]

[^1]: source? I've done hiring. 

Those are money they could use to invest in retention, education, or even in their compensation offer to quickly close the hiring deal and avoid paying for the ad. 

In practice, this isn't what happens. Many companies are perfectly happy to pay the middleman more money than the people who will potentially be working for them. 

The explanation is because the middleman itself IS the one working for them.
