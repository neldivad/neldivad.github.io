They ask me how I beat the market.

It's the wrong question.

You don't beat the market. You beat the investor.

They see me launch 100 different speculative funds.

A hundred bets on black. A hundred moonshots.

All as volatile as the mood of my girlfriend.

They think I'm crazy.

I dont think they understand

Here's the playbook.

99 of them will crater. We bury them quietly. No fanfare.

<!--truncate-->

But one of them, by pure statistical chance, will have a spectacular year.

50% CAGR. Maybe 100%.

We take that one fund, the statistical anomaly. 

And we market it as proof of my divine insight.

The public, wanting some Stonks, pours their life savings into it.

The moment our AUM hits a billion, our strategy changes.

The high-risk bets are over.

We sell everything and buy a simple S&P 500 index.

My clients think they're invested in a high-octane rocket ship.

They're actually in the world's most expensive tracker fund.

They pay me a 2% management fee for performance I no longer attempt to generate.

My genius wasn't in picking stocks.

It was in building a machine that converts survivorship bias into a perpetual fee-generating annuity.

They think I'm creating generational wealth for them.

I'm creating generational wealth for myself, by doing absolutely nothing.
