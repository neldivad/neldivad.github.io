I am a humble Nigerian prince who has trillions of assets under management. 

or at list thats what I tell my leads on email. 

You see, I write very much bad english. Lots of typo. 

Literealy no excuse when autocorrect, spell checker, or ai exist. 

You think I'm so stupid. Small IQ.

You much understanding me? No I don't think you do.

You see, my bad writing is a net. A net with very big holes.

<!--truncate-->

A smart man, a man with honor, sees the holes.

He swims away. He has work to do. He has no time for my cheat.

But the greedy man, the fool. 

His eyes are so full of money, he cannot see the holes in the net.

He thinks "This prince is dumb. I am smart. I will trick him."

He much understanding me? No I don't think he do.

Because he is the one who is tricked. He is tricked by the greed in his own sole.

You do not need to be smart. You just need to find men who are not.

Your bad english is a perfect filter for character. A big IQ test for stupidity.

If someone can take my email with typo seriously. Imagine what else he can believe in. 

I made over $29k doing this.

Money advice will come when you behidn me.
