You think you go to an elite university for the education.

I dont think you understand.

The lectures are on YouTube for free. ChatGPT can teach you quantum mechanics while you drink your coffee.

If you're just there for knowledge, you have already failed.

You think it's for the "network." A business cardholder for names.

Still missing the point.

Because if its true, you could get it by joining my Discord server for $50/mth (DM me to join, totally not sponsored btw)

<!--truncate-->

An elite university is not a school. It's a curated marketplace.

A place where two very specific groups are brought together.

Nepo-babies: The sons and daughters of the ruling class. The legacy admissions. The future owners.

Broke-nerds: The brilliant, hungry, and strategically poor. The scholarship kids. The future workhorses.

Nepobaby isn't there to learn how to build the machine. They are there to identify the best cogs.

Broke-nerd thinks he's competing for a grade in economics. 

He's actually auditioning for the role of future CFO for the boy whose thesis he's helping to write.

He thinks his 4.0 is a ticket to succes -- He is the ticket to success for another nepobaby.
 
People cry about legacy admissions. They call it unfair.

I dont think they understand. 

Elite universities loses half their value the moment legacy admissions goes away. 

Because then it no longer guarantees the buyers are in the room.

Without the promise of rubbing shoulders with nepobabies, the broke-nerds would go elsewhere.

The prestige would evaporate. The marketplace would collapse.

It's the most efficient talent acquisition funnel ever designed.

A four-year, high-stakes interview where the assets pay for the privilege of being scouted.

Your diploma isn't a certificate of knowledge. It's a proof-of-purchase receipt to be a high-end employee.

Do you really need context on this one...?
