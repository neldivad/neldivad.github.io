My competitors love to talk about their "grind culture."

They boast about their golden handcuffs and 90-hour work weeks.

They think squeezing their talent is a sign of strength.

They see their employees as costs to be managed. I see them as assets that can walk away.

They trap a 20-year veteran with a complex equity plan he can't liquidate.

They save a few million on his comp and think they're geniuses.

Then one day, the one who actually originates the deals, gets a call. He realizes his cage is made of paper. 

He walks.

And that "cost-saving" just created a nine-figure hole in their next fund.

They try to buy him back. They offer him 100x what it would have cost to just treat him right. He still says no.

My strategy is different.

I find my true superstars, and I pay them obscene amounts of money.

I give them liquidity. I give them respect. I give them a platform.

It looks expensive to my rivals.

But my firm has become a sanctuary. A landing pad for the best talent my competitors burn out.

They do the hard work of training them. They foster the resentment. Then I poach the finished product. 

My single greatest source of talent is my competitors' stupidity.

Follow me for more financial advice.
