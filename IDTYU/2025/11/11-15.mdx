I have a LinkedIn profile.

But that's not the one I use every day.

My most valuable account is a second, secret profile.

Let's call it the "graveyard account."

Its connections are a curated list of failures.

Every employee I've ever fired. Every founder whose startup I crushed. Every candidate we rejected.

They all get a connection request from this account.

My entire executive circle is also connected to this graveyard.

It's our private intelligence network.

When we interview someone and they're not a fit, we don't send a rejection letter.

We're polite. "We'll keep your resume on file."

A day later, the graveyard account sends them a connection request.

I dont think they understand.

If they accept, a quiet signal goes out to my entire network. It's a digital flag.

A subtle notification that this person failed to make the cut.

When a friend at another firm is considering that same candidate, he doesn't need to call me.

He just checks if they're connected to the graveyard. The network has already spoken.

It's not a blacklist. It's a shared risk-management system.

People think LinkedIn is for building networks.

I use it to build firewalls. This is how we cut through the noise and get our signal.

And I'm selling membership to my partners who wants this pure alpha.
