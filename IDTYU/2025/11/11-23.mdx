I am a humble banker from China who only has a few billion dollars of asset under management

My job to to give credit card to those who ask

29 yo male founder? Reject 

19 yo female OF content creator? $100k 

Where can?! Injustice! You say.

You ask me why woman get more credit card money.

You tell me you have more money. Your score is good. 

You think my bank is stupid. I think you no understand.

<!--truncate-->

My bank is not your friend. My bank is a hunter.

Hunter look at you. You are careful. You pay bill.

You have honor. You dont bring shame to family. Hunter hate it. 

For hunter, you are bad day. No food.

Hunter look at this woman with little honor.

Maybe she like buy shiny thing. Maybe she forget to pay all money.

Hunter see this. Hunter smile. This fish love the hook.

Big credit card number is not a prize. It is a bigger piece of bait. A bigger trap for the hungry fish.

You think bank give her money because they think she is rich.

You foolish. 

Bank give her money because they think she will be poor.

Poor with their money. Paying interest forever.

This is not credit test. This is greed test.

You are smart, so you get small hook. We think she is greedy, so she get big net.

Still not understanding? She is the customer number one! 

More money advice will come when you behind me.

## Context

Especially when money is fiat with central banks, most banks are happy to never get their principal back -- it's not even real in the first place. 

The best case is that you stay indebted to the loan forever. 

They'll be happy to "forgive your debts" after 20 years slaving away on interest. 

And that's also why they don't like lending to responsible and wealthy people -- contrary to the term "creditworthiness" -- which mistakenly implies someone with a lot of trust. 

Wake up wagie. Banks care about profits more than trust.
