A big man plays a game with me. Every day.

He holds out two hands.

One hand has a shiny silver coin. The other has green paper money.

He says, "Pick one."

I always take the shiny coin.

"See? He's so stupid," he says.

The big man laughs. His friends laugh too.

<!--truncate-->

I dont think the big man understands.

The paper money is more. I know this.

But if I take the paper money. The game is over. He won't play with me tomorrow.

So I take the shiny coin.

He feels smart. I get to keep his money.

He thinks he is playing a game with a dumb kid. He is wrong.

I am playing a game with a dumb big man.

I made over $10 doing this trick.

Follow me for more money tricks.
