19 yo female entrepreneur came to me for advice.

She had a digital asset. An OF page, but not enough traffic.

I beta-tested her product. I found no issues. 

It was her marketing.

She wanted to buy ads, build a brand, be "aspirational" and be "adventurous".

I told her that was a losing strategy.

My advice was simple.

Stop trying to be liked. Start trying to be misunderstood.

<!--truncate-->

I told her to find the loudest male podcasters. The ones who built their brand by "dunking" on women.

And I gave her a script of the most vapid, infuriating things to say.

She played her part to perfection. She became the Jim Ho among the gym bros.

Their audience rushed to the comments to call her a moron. She goes viral.

I dont think they understand.

They thought they were winning an argument. They were driving traffic.

Every outraged share was a free ad. Every condescending comment was a sales funnel. Their hate became her marketing budget.

Her revenue traction erected as fast as the blood pressure of her audiences.

You thought you were laughing at an idiot. You were her unpaid marketing intern.

She still sends me thank you notes everyday for clowning her on internet. 

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context

I dont think you understand. Gym bros and OF models are actually in a symbiotic relationship. 

You think girls are stupid enough to line up in a room to get clowned by a guy and be shown to the entire internet? 

Girls who sell their body take a lot of risks -- they only have 10 years to do it well. If a scheme doesn't work out fast, you bet they'll quickly pivot to something else. 

With over 400K members in r/onlyfansadvice, the ideas that the network can cook up is miles better than an individual person with prejudice.
