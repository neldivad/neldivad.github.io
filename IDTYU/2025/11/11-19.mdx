I am a humble owner of a $100m PE business.

My firm is the dream destination for every ambitious MBA.

My recruits arrive from investment banks, broken and sleep-deprived.

Thinking they've finally "made it." In reality, they've just entered a more sophisticated cage.

Their 90-hour work weeks aren't a temporary sacrifice.

It's a filtering mechanism for obedience.

I don't need to manage them. Their own desperate ambition does it for me.

They're not building a career. They're building my LPs' returns on the wreckage of their 20s.

Then there are my veterans. My 50-yo men.

They look rich on paper. But their liquidity is a mirage I control.

We give them "equity." Shares they can't sell on the open market.

If they leave, they must sell it back to me. At a "Fair Market Value" that my senior partners determine.

How fair you ask? 

A 50% discount when I'm the one holding the checkbook sounds perfectly fair.

I've trained them to obsess over a 0.5% variance in a spreadsheet. It keeps them busy while I own their net worth.

Even my Senior Managing Directors, the gods they all aspire to be, fly economy plus.

They flash a lifestyle funded by a line of credit from the firm. 

They chase a "carry" check that might vest in a decade. If my fund performs...

They think of it as a golden handcuff.

I dont think they understand.

I don't need handcuffs when I've built the perfect prison.

A prison where the inmates pay me for the privilege of being there.
