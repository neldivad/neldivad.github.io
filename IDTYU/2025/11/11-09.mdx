Whenever I stop at a red light, I always leave an entire car length of empty space in front of me.

Big enough to annoy people. Small enough to not obstruct traffic. 

The driver behind me will be furious. He thinks I am incompetent.

I dont think he understands. 

The gap is intentional. 

For ninety seconds, I am the most important person in his life.

His world shrinks to the two metres of asphalt I have denied him.

He is consumed by a rage he cannot act upon. He is my hostage.

<!--truncate-->

This is a micro-dose of true power.

The last-minute "urgent" meeting request at 4:55 PM on a Friday.

The deliberate, two-day delay in replying to a crucial email.

The "accidental" omission of a key stakeholder from an important memo.

These are not oversights. They are strategic injections of friction.

Subtle reminders of who controls the pace. Who owns the time on the clock.

You don't need money to feel powerful. You just have to think different. 

Follow me for more rizz.
