I successfully made a man whose penis fall off as soon as he finished having sex. 

Or at least, I made a plant equivalent of it. 

You see, the mad scientist I hired has create a seed where as soon as its done growing, no seeds will spawn out of it. 

I sold them at the market for very cheap. our customers love it. 

I dont think they understand. 

<!--truncate-->

With our self-castrating seeds, our customers will never be able to grow their own plants. They will have to keep buying our seeds. 

The real genius is in our pesticide. 

All of our seeds grow up to become that same plant with the same weakness -- the kind of weakness our pesticides are enigneered to deal with. 

This means when our customers buy their seeds to start their business, they will also be buying the microtransactions we are going to sell them later. 

If they complain? Tough luck. Where else can they get their supply?

Follow me for more financial advice.

## Context

If I have to name the company, I would have to put up a legal disclaimer. 

Fortunately, they are not hard to guess. 

The good story is that this company ended up getting acquired, and the parent company lose over 80% of its shareholder value. Rare case when greed is punished. 

That said, I bet the people behind the scheme made it out like bandits. They used the public shareholders as exit liqudity knowing how much legal liabilities they would have to pay over the coming decade.
