i successfully made a man whose penis fall off as soon as he finished having sex. 

Or at least, I made a plant equivalent of it. 

You see, the mad scientist I hired has create a seed where as soon as its done growing, no seeds will spawn out of it. 

i sold them at the market for very cheap. our customers love it. 

I dont think they understand. 

<!--truncate-->

our customers to will never be able to grow their own plants. they will have to keep buying our seeds. 

The real genius is in our pesticide. 

All of our seeds grow up to become that same plant with the same weakness -- the kind of weakness our pesticides are enigneered to deal with. 

this means when our customers buy their seeds to start their business, they will also be buying the microtransactions we are going to sell them later. 

if they complain? tough luck. where else can they get their supply?
