My sales team was complaining about indecisive clients.

They blamed the pitch. The product. The market.

I dont think they understand. 

The problem wasn't what we were saying. It was who was listening.

So I hired an asset, not a salesperson.

Her name is Anya. She has zero sales experience.

Her only requirement? Look gorgeous and classy. 

Then, her job is to join our most important Zoom calls...

And do absolutely nothing (she plays Honkai Star Rail while pretending to take notes).

<!--truncate-->

We introduce her as our "Senior Partner, observing the deal flow."

She sits slightly off-camera, looking unimpressed.

She never speaks. She never smiles. She simply exists.

The effect is alchemical.

My client's dynamic shifts instantly.

This is no longer a sales call. It's a status audition.

They aren't just buying from me anymore. They are trying to prove they are important enough for Anya's time.

To say "no" is no longer a business decision. It's an admission of weakness in front of a beautiful woman.

Our close rate on major deals increased 42%. Our average contract value increased by 69%.

They pay their invoices faster, too.

I didn't improve the product. I weaponized the male customer ego.

Then I expanded the team to include: Deborah, Chichi, Eimi, Miya

Demo calls? Either one. 

Support calls? Any one who wasn't from demo call. 

Quarterly reviews? Either two. 

Payment collection? The angry looking one. 

It's the most effective form of psychological leverage I've ever deployed.

The ROI? Infinite.

Because they all pay me for their own office attire and makeup to LARP as an employed woman. 

Follow me for more financial advice.
