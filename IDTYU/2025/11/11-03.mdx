Remote work is just better for business.

My team presented the data. They showed me how remote work is cheaper.

Productivity is up. Employees are happier. They told me we were winning.

I told them the data was irrelevant. Then I issued a full, mandatory RTO policy.

9-6. Six days a week.

My consultants called it financial malpractice. That I'm not maximizing shareholder value.

I dont think they understand.

The goal isn't to make more money. I already have all the money.

The goal is to feel something money can't buy.

Control.

The hours they lose in traffic is not a productivity loss. It is a loyalty tax, paid to me daily.

Every minute they sit fuming in their car is every minute they remember who owns their calendar.

I paid for their hours. I'm going to use all of their hours. 

I smile when I imagine them in the traffic, thinking about all the other things they could be doing. Their inconvenience is my dividend.

You think my office is for collaboration. My office is a theater for obedience.

These people aren't just my employees. They are a collection. And I like my collection where I can see it.

Besides, my brother owns the parking lot next to my office and he needs his income.
