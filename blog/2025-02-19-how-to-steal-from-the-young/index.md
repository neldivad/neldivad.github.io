Today's generation is prosperous. But it's also plagued by problems similar to the past.  

Increasing wealth gaps, squeezed middle class, low birth rates, public debts that are increasing unsustainable, difficult job market.

## Introduction  

The mainstream narrative now is that the rich have been exploiting the poor, and that all of the problems will go away if only we tax them enough or regulate their profits such that it is no longer predatory. Or, it's a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  

The problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn't clear if the rich was actually the problem.  

In the French Revolution, it's not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It's more like the top 1% against the top 0.1%. Most of the common people don't even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  

Put simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it's in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.  

How then should one find the dishonest actor that explains all of the present problems and injustice without resorting to sloppy reasoning that matches what the mainstream wants you to antagonize?

## Discovering the anatomy of the heist  

Most understand that problems and inefficiency don't come out of nowhere, therefore something/someone must be responsible. The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is **deliberate** or **accidental**.  

Many things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  

**Example**: the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford tertiary education to gain the cultural capital required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  

<!-- {context} Consider adding a source here to support the argument about job complexity and bureaucracy driving wealth gaps. For example, you could cite studies on the increasing cost of compliance with regulations and its impact on income inequality.   -->

If you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees/license to bypass these regulations are the root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind, but you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  

In fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  

On a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China's gaokao. The same system that is the most unfair and repressive to lower class also happened to get the most support and defense from the lower class.  

Gaokao creates "unequal" outcomes and "widening social class," in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people "accidentally" creating social division.  

In effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the candidate of "opportunity stealing hero that escaped public scrutiny" (OSHTEPS).  

<!-- {context} Here, you might clarify what you mean by "opportunity stealing hero that escaped public scrutiny" for readers unfamiliar with this term or concept.   -->

If you are convinced that China's gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you'll also find that most state's public education don't do better.  

In US, public schools spend $20k per student for the results of 13% illiteracy rate. Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  

<!-- {context} To strengthen this argument, consider including a direct source or data point to substantiate the $20k per student spending and the 13% illiteracy rate. This would make the comparison more credible.   -->

If the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  

Yet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSHTEPS.  

With 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  

- Must have a way to avoid competition, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.  
- Decisions are undemocratic (regulations setup by "think tanks" and "experts")  
- Victims having "Stockholm syndrome" to net negative practices. (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)  

<!-- {context} Consider expanding on what you mean by "Stockholm syndrome" in this context. How exactly do these systems induce a form of Stockholm syndrome in their victims?   -->

With such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.  

If you enjoy where your logic will take you, stop scrolling and start thinking and see if your answers match with mine later.  

I will do the honors and take the risk of exposing institutions with questionable motive and outcomes.  

Here goes.

## Heist Showdown  

### Central banks  

#### Avoid competition:  

Lender of last resort. Independence from state government  

<!-- {context} Consider adding a brief explanation of what the "lender of last resort" function entails and how it allows central banks to avoid competition.   -->

#### Undemocratic  

The public cannot elect a fed chair. The election process of a fed chair is almost as secretive as the election of pope.  

<!-- {context} You might clarify or provide a source explaining the secretive nature of the Fed chair selection process. Many readers may not be familiar with the specifics of Federal Reserve governance.   -->

The fed chair can make policies that influence credit markets such that it directly kills business or raise portfolio value.  

The 2% inflation target is a dogma, not an expert research, public agreement.  

<!-- {context} Consider including a source or reference to how the 2% inflation target is determined and perceived as a dogma.   -->

#### Enough victims with Stockholm.  

**Victims**: anyone who owns cash.  
**Stockholmers**: anyone with an office job, financed by state contracts. Anyone who owns a home.  

<!-- {context} Clarify why these groups are considered victims or "Stockholmers." How exactly do central bank policies exploit cash holders, office workers, and homeowners?   -->

Why it's Stockholm. Your employment is an illusion. They will still raise back enough taxes from you to make back the money they printed to pay you. If you have any more left to spend, they will devalue it by printing the next round of money.  

### Human resources and recruiting industry  

<!-- {context} Consider providing a brief introduction or overview of this section to set the stage for readers.   -->

**Anticompetitive**: have you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?  

**Undemocratic**:  
HR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  

**Example**, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn't problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.  

<!-- {context} Consider including a citation or study that evaluates the correlation between educational degrees and actual competency. For example, you could cite research on the effectiveness of degree requirements in predicting job performance.   -->

Education degrees can function as a competency signal in certain industry, notably those in STEM. However, we seen HR discriminate non-degree applications regardless of the job function.  

It doesn't help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world. Degrees now function more like a "license to work" that gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.  

<!-- {context} Consider including data or sources that document the rising costs of higher education and its diminishing returns in the job market.   -->

**HR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects.**  

<!-- {context} Elaborate on what you mean by "scientific method" in this context. How could HR departments implement rigorous testing or evaluation processes to assess candidate quality more objectively?   -->

## Is it a "middleman problem"?  

"**I'm not happy with most of these in the list, but aren't the rich the real final boss?"**  

**It's too convenient, too big of the brush, and often results in bad policies. Instead, I think it's more helpful to expose people to the anatomy of how institutions can take advantage of the public, and**
