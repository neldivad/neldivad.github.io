        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When writing software, the longer we spend our lvies doing it, the more we often encounter tradeoffs in information, like abstraction and locality of behavior (LoB).</p>
<p>The core principle of abstraction is "Do not repeat yourself (DRY)". Meaning, we should avoid duplicating code and import whenever you need to.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is that behaviors get inherited too often, to the point where making any local changes become inflexible.</p>
<p>The most common example will be Bootstrap CSS. It tries hard to not repeat itself, so you have class components all stuffed within a <code>style.css</code> file.</p>
<p>The issue happens when you want to change the look of a component. You have to go through the entire file and find the class you want to change. Often you realize there is a lot of collisions of CSS between different class names, EG: <code>.table-striped</code>, <code>.table-striped-primary</code>, <code>table-dark-primary</code>, inheriting from <code>.table</code>.</p>
<p>At some point you forget which one does what, which one inherits which CSS, and you end up with a mess.</p>
<p>Tailwind CSS solves this by describing all the styles within the same file. EG: <code>class="bg-blue-500 text-white outline-none transtion-all duration-100 pd-1"</code>.</p>
<p>The problem with Tailwind CSS is that it is repetivive, so your code is very unreadable. When you work on both Bootstrap and Tailwind, inevitably you find that both suck for different reasons -- there is an inherent tradeoff between abstraction and locality of behavior.</p>

<p>If you really paid attention, you notice that a lot of natural language we use take for granted of these principles.</p>
<p>You see "abstration", "LoB", and "collisions" happening all the time.</p>
<p>I will share the 3 language I'm most familiar with, being English, Japanese, and Chinese and show how each natural language overcome its encoding challenges, and how many of their problems can predict the problems of software projects that do share common traits with those natural languages.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-functional-to-object-oriented">From functional to object-oriented<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/natural-language-is-software#from-functional-to-object-oriented" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From functional to object-oriented" title="Direct link to From functional to object-oriented">​</a></h2>
<p>In software development, the transition from functional programming (FP) to object-oriented programming (OOP) is an evolution to manage complexity.</p>
<p>FP emphasizes pure functions, meaning functions do not modify variables but instead generate new ones as an output. Pure functions are "pure" because they always return the same output for the same argument values. In effect, it serves as a very simple motif for any program.</p>
<p>OOP focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, so state changes are supported and behavior can be extended.</p>
<p>The natural language equivalent of FP is the use of alphabets (English), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character_strokes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">character strokes</a> (Chinese), hiragana (Japanese) to convey meaning.</p>
<p>However, users of the natural language will eventually realize that using only basic building blocks result in lots of redundancy. Also, if the sequence of characters repeats too often, it also gets confusing to interpret.</p>
<p>A programmer that deals with a functional programming framework will also come to feel the same problem after working on the project long enough (redudancy, confusion during long sequences.)</p>
<p>The natural language equivalent of OOP is the use of prefixes, suffixes, and roots to convey meaning.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="linear-extensions-in-object-en">Linear extensions in object (EN)<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/natural-language-is-software#linear-extensions-in-object-en" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Linear extensions in object (EN)" title="Direct link to Linear extensions in object (EN)">​</a></h2>
<p>In English, words are often built from smaller parts, almost like how LEGO pieces fit together to make something bigger. Take the word "carbon monoxide" as an example. Each part of the word means something specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon: a type of element</li>
<li>Mono: meaning "one"</li>
<li>Oxide: a type of compound derived from oxygen element</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put these pieces together, they form a new word that tells you it's a compound made of one carbon atom. Even if you're not a chemistry expert, the word gives you clues about what it means!</p>
<p>This modular approach is cool because it lets us understand and create new words by combining familiar parts. It's like how you can mix different LEGO pieces to build something entirely new.</p>
<p>However, the linearity and locality of English means you will often get very long words when trying to describe something specific or technical.</p>
<p><code>Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</code>, which has 45 letters, refers to a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust.</p>
<p>How it came to be this long is because you want to fit and extend multiple classes into an expression <code>pneumo</code>, <code>micro</code>, <code>silica</code>, <code>osis</code>, and you required the locality, IE: fixing all the motifs together so those classes don't get accidentally spilled to a different word.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="component-attachment-in-object-cn">Component attachment in object (CN)<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/natural-language-is-software#component-attachment-in-object-cn" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Component attachment in object (CN)" title="Direct link to Component attachment in object (CN)">​</a></h2>
<p>In Chinese, many characters are built from smaller parts called radicals or components, which give clues about their meaning. This is similar to object-oriented programming in software, where objects can include other objects or inherit their properties.</p>
<p>Most of the oldest and common characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>日 (rì) means "sun"</li>
<li>月 (yuè) means "moon"</li>
<li>木 (mù) means "tree"</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like how you mix LEGO pieces, Chinese combines these common words to become themes of other words, known as 部首 (bùshǒu).</p>
<ul>
<li>明 (míng) is made by combining 日 (sun) and 月 (moon). Together, they mean something bright.</li>
<li>晨 (chén) means "dawn" and uses 日 (sun) to show light.</li>
<li>果 (guǒ) means "fruit" and uses 木 (tree), showing where fruit comes from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike English where expression get extended by adding suffixes and elongating the word, Chinese extend expression by fitting multiple "components" (IE: the primary characters) into a box and identifying it as a unique character. You can treat each Chinese character as an individual script file.</p>
<p>This compression means Chinese has a natural advantage to use very little words to convey lots of meaning.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-1">Example 1:<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/natural-language-is-software#example-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example 1:" title="Direct link to Example 1:">​</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>掌声的嗜好成了瘾症</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The preference for applause has become an addiction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-2">Example 2:<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/natural-language-is-software#example-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example 2:" title="Direct link to Example 2:">​</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>在深海漩涡里翻腾摧毁一切只剩下无可挽回的罪人</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The waves of the whirlpool in a deep sea are breaking everything, leaving behind only a guilty person with no redemption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In effect, Chinese has demonstrated the advantage of a more compressed abstraction, most obviously the number of phonemes required to finish a sentence.</p>
<p>However, anyone who has done enough software will soon guess the next problem with Chinese component approach.</p>
<p>Chinese has a lot of characters. In effect, each character is a class of its own, therefore your database of words requires a huge collection.</p>
<p>Unlike English where you only need 26 characters (maybe more if you also want to include Greek symbols or accented symbols), Chinese has between <a href="https://www.hutong-school.com/how-many-chinese-characters-are-there" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3000 to 100,000 characters</a> (depending on the level of complexity of the dictionary) you are using.</p>
<p>Not only that Chinese has more characters to track because each expression "wants" a word to represent it, we either have to create a new word to represent the expression, or we have to borrow a reserved word to represent it (IE: similar but have different meanings). This is the software equivalent of "class collision".</p>
<p>While one can always squash more components into the script, the obvious disadvantage is that the character becomes harder to write and unnecessarily niche. Check out the abomination of the few examples that still survived today:</p>
<ul>
<li>攀 (Pān) (Climbing)</li>
<li>罐 (Guàn) (Can)</li>
</ul>
<p>One obvious solution is to use compounded words to represent the expression.</p>

<ul>
<li>方: square, direction</li>
<li>言: speech</li>
</ul>
<p>You notice this compounding style is very similar to English method of linearly extending a word with suffix: EG: "hydrophobic" as "water-repelling".</p>
<p>However, the problem with Chinese that the characters they can extend is restricted by all the options they can use from the 3000-word dictionary in the first place. 3000 characters isn't enough to cover every concept relative to English where you can use any word as  suffixes, prefixes, and roots.</p>
<p>This abstraction makes Chinese very "opinionated" in terms of how concepts can be extended, much like our experience as developers with OOP languages.</p>
<p>You can observe this disadvantage very obviously during EN and CN attempts to describe a technical or scientific concept (CN is much more ambiguous than EN).</p>

<li>Penicillium chrysogenum</li>
<li>产黄青霉菌</li>

<p>In Japanese, much of the ancient scripts are based on kanji characters, which uses the same writing system as Chinese but with different meaning.</p>
<p>In the meantime around 8th century, the Japanese had the demand to represent the sounds of the spoken language more accurately. They invented a "manyogana" system, where Chinese characters were used to represent phonetic sounds rather than their original meanings. Its the equivalent of repurposing a class with different functions (bad, bad, bad idea in software).</p>
<p>Eventually, sounds and phonemes became a mainstream way of encoding language. To avoid the confusion of shared class problem, the Japanese adopted 2 new writing systems: hiragana and katakana to represent sounds.</p>
<p>Hiragana, a syllabary with a limited set of characters, serves a functional purpose by providing phonetic values. But independently it runs into the problem of FP -- expressing a complete sentence is lengthy, confusing, and hard to read.</p>
<p>To make things more readable, the Japanese combined hiragana with kanji. The result is a writing system using 2 distinct character dictionaries.</p>
<p>From a software developer's perspective, this is a maintenance nightmare. It's like adding a plugin (hiragana) to your monolith (kanji). Not only do the user needs to understand each character from kanji, now they also need to understand each character from hiragana.</p>
<p>But this combination also solves some big problems, like "class collision" and limited ways to expand experienced by CN. It's like giving LEGO pieces different colors.</p>
<p>For example, the kanji 生 (せい, しょう) can mean "life" or "raw," and when combined with different hiragana, it forms different words.</p>
<ul>
<li>生まれる(うまれる) (生-mameru): to be born</li>
<li>生み出す(うみだす) (生-midasu) : to create, to invent</li>
<li>生きる (いきる) (生-kiru) : to live</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a tip of the iceberg for Japanese interaction between kanji component and hiragana component. More advanced use of langage include compounded kanji that result in different pronounciation.</p>
<p>Example kanji 月 (つき / tsuki), which means "moon" independently. When combined compounded with different kanji results in different hiragana pronounces.</p>
<ul>
<li>月刊 (げっかん / gekkan): means "monthly," like a magazine you get every month.</li>
<li>一月 (いちがつ / ichigatsu): means "January,"</li>
<li>満月 (まんげつ / mangetsu): means "full moon"</li>
</ul>
<p>The base <code>tsuki</code> can have its state changed to <code>gek-</code>, <code>gatsu</code>, <code>getsu</code> depending on context.</p>

<p>The evolution from functional to object-oriented structures in language is a challenge every developer have to go through as they raise in seniority.</p>
<p>Writing code and maintaining software seriously will also expose developers to the tradeoffs of abstraction and locality of behavior.</p>
<p>Software developers must manage libraries, frameworks, dependency hell, exponential explosion of required context (aka tech debt).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can pay attention to how natural language spent thousands of years evolving to solve the same problem. Often, natural language give us a clue on the architecture of software, as well as predicting in advance the problems those designs will eventually face.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We celebrate heroes, entrepreneurs, artists, and independent thinkers. These individuals are often showcased as beacons of innovation and progress.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this glorification, conformism remains is the norm, not exception through all observed history.</p>

<p>At any given moment, the majority tends to follow established norms, whether they are being conservative or simply unable to form independent thoughts.</p>
<p>If we value independence and innovation so highly, why do conformists continue to outnumber independent thinkers?</p>
<p>Is there an inherent advantage to conformism that ensures its prevalence, or are we merely paying lip service to the idea of valuing independence?</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolutionary-perspectives-on-conformism-and-defiance">Evolutionary perspectives on conformism and defiance<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/is-conformism-a-viable-strategy#evolutionary-perspectives-on-conformism-and-defiance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolutionary perspectives on conformism and defiance" title="Direct link to Evolutionary perspectives on conformism and defiance">​</a></h2>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, traits that confer a survival advantage are more likely to persist and propagate.</p>
<p>If independent thinking provided a clear evolutionary edge, you should expect independent thinkers to gradually outpace conformists.</p>
<p>However, historical observation contradicts this expectation. Conformists have consistently outnumbered independent thinkers across different eras.</p>
<p>This begs the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does independent thinking hold an evolutionary disadvantage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does conformism offer unseen benefits that contribute to group survival and cohesion?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to have low opinions about conformism, or towards conformists. Yet, most of us don't recognize how much conformism we do on a regularly basis.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense to follow the crowd. In data science, there is a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that is used very often and efficient to compute, especially if the application needs to make the prediction fast.</p>
<p>An example of a KNN is to associate a Japanese user with the average Japanese user. The software doesn't try to do fancy computation to model the user at high fidelity.</p>
<p>In financial markets, there is a trend following strategy, or ARIMA models, where the prediction of prices is based on past few day's prices. It's more "braindead" relative to exhaustively analyzing earnings report, growth rates, transcripts to predict prices and to generate a new valuation every time data changes.</p>
<p>Conformism brings order and stability, allowing societies to function smoothly. It facilitates the scaling of power and resources, which can enhance the collective evolutionary fitness of a group.</p>
<p>"Trust the process" works well in the sense that the group can save on computing and decision cost. The catch is that the process must keep working.</p>
<p>So a group of conformist who happened to be lucky enough to follow a right set of values will grow fast enough to destroy the population of a group of deviants who are either busy doing their own thing, or busy disagreeing among themselves.</p>
<p>However, if the conformist values misalign, mistakes cascades and wrong social directions are hard to stop -- the Pied Piper of Hamlin will lead all rats to drown in the river.</p>
<p>Conformism can also be exploited a subset of manipulative deviants, as values get hijacked to benefit a small cabal of deviants (cult leaders and equivalents).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evolutionary-disadvantage-of-deviants">Evolutionary disadvantage of deviants<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/is-conformism-a-viable-strategy#evolutionary-disadvantage-of-deviants" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Evolutionary disadvantage of deviants" title="Direct link to Evolutionary disadvantage of deviants">​</a></h2>
<p>Independent thinkers, while often celebrated, <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles">frequently face challenges that conformists do not.</a></p>
<p>While we see glorious success from a selected few independent thinkers and frequently talk about them, it is often the case we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Many artists, intellectuals, and other independent thinkers struggle financially and in terms of reproductive success. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/is-conformism-a-viable-strategy#user-content-fn-1-a225e9" id="user-content-fnref-1-a225e9" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. This raises questions about the evolutionary viability of independent thinking and deviance.</p>
<p>In fact, we could use the market perspective to understand the quantitative tradeoffs and ROI between conformism and independent thinking.</p>
<p>In most advanced economies, the number of salaried workers (conformists) is much higher than the number of entrepreneurs (deviants).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the average earnings of salaried workers is higher than the average earnings of entrepreneurs -- an evidence of the survival advantage of conformism. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/is-conformism-a-viable-strategy#user-content-fn-2-a225e9" id="user-content-fnref-2-a225e9" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In ancient China, independent barbarians get defeated or absorbed by the more conforming empire.</p>

<p>The market perspective used to understand the quantitative tradeoffs between conformism and independent thinking is one way to do it, but we could also use AI simulations to explore the interplay between environmental factors, incentive structures, and behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>By observing how AI agents respond to different reward functions, we can gain a better understanding of when and why humans might lean towards conformism or independent thinking.</p>
<p>So far, the most interesting AI agents used to simulate human cooperation is the <a href="https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axelrod project</a>.</p>
<p>The discovery is that the greatest survivors are agents who employ "Tit-for-tat" strategies in iterative Prisoner's Dilemma games.</p>
<p>Perhaps, a similar agent simulation could be used to discover the natural bias of agents towards conformism or defiance when status conscious becomes a parameter.</p>

<p>The problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn't clear if the rich was actually the problem.</p>
<p>In the French Revolution, it's not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It's more like the <a href="https://x.com/GaletteSaw6/status/1892255392987582924/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top 1% against the top 0.1%</a>. Most of the common people don't even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.</p>
<p>Put simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it's in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.</p>
<p>How then should one find the dishonest actor that explains all of the present problems and injustice without resorting to sloppy reasoning that matches what the mainstream wants you to antagonize?</p>

<p>Most understand that problems and inefficiency don't come out of nowhere, therefore something/someone must be responsible. The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is <strong>deliberate</strong> or <strong>accidental</strong>.</p>
<p>Many things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.</p>
<p>Example, the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford <a href="https://wcer.wisc.edu/docs/working-papers/Working_Paper_No_2017_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tertiary education to gain the cultural capital</a> required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.</p>
<p>If you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees / license to bypass these regulations are the <strong>root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind</strong>. Yet, you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.</p>
<p>In fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.</p>
<p>On a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China's Gaokao -- The same system that is the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/22125868211035802?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most unfair and repressive to lower class</a> also happened to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/comment/k42ydza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get the most support and defense from the lower class</a>.</p>
<p>Gaokao creates "unequal" outcomes and "widening social class," in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people "accidentally" creating social division.</p>
<p>In effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the a category I would classify as "opportunity stealing hero" (OSH).</p>
<p>If you are convinced that China's gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you'll also find that most state's public education don't do better.</p>
<p><a href="https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In US, public schools spend $20k per student</a> for the results of <a href="https://www.thenationalliteracyinstitute.com/post/literacy-statistics-2024-2025-where-we-are-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% illiteracy rate</a>. Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.</p>
<p>If the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.</p>
<p>Yet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSH.</p>
<p>With 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Must have a way to avoid competition</strong>, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Decisions are undemocratic</strong> (regulations setup by "think tanks" and "experts")</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/whats_the_deal_with_chinas_gao_kao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Victims having "Stockholm syndrome"</strong> to net negative practices</a>. (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)</li>
</ul>
<p>With such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.</p>
<p>If you enjoy where your logic will take you, stop scrolling and start thinking and see if your answers match with mine later.</p>
<p>I will do the honors and take the risk of exposing institutions with questionable motive and outcomes.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>

<p>Central banks serve as the lender of last resort -- a function that allows them to provide emergency liquidity to banks, thereby forestalling systemic collapse.</p>
<p>But no one else gets this right to create value out of nothing. While it's hard to say they are dishonest, there is no way we can know how accountable too.</p>
<p>In a competitive market, an unaccountable bank would face consequences for poor policies. In central bank's case, mostly its just "bad luck", "bad timing", "oops".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great recruiter should be paid by the quality of candidates they hire. In practice, recruiters get paid by the number of candidates they closed.</p>
<p>This means there is no pressure to properly vet for candidates for employers, or no pressure to help job seekers land jobs. You pay your LinkedIn Premium and they play you for a fool.</p>
<p>In more competitive markets, there is a "money back guarantee" for people who are unsatisfied with the product.  A simple way to make HR competitive is to also have a "money back guarantee" system, where the recruiter forfeits their commission if the candidate is bad, or if the candidate couldn't find a job.</p>
<p>Why don't we do it?</p>

<p>HR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.</p>
<p>For example, HR policies routinely use expensive educational degrees as prerequisites for roles -- even when the actual performance gap between degree holders and non-degree holders is negligible in many real-world contexts.</p>
<p>In effect, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn't problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.</p>
<p>To find out if degrees, licenses, or other credentials are actually a competency signal, a scientific method would be to look at the data by systematically measuring the quality of both recruits and rejects using an objective function.</p>
<p><strong>I have hardly met any HR that does this</strong> <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-public#user-content-fn-2-e68ca5" id="user-content-fnref-2-e68ca5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world.</p>
<p>Degrees now function more like a "ticket you buy for the chance to work" that <a href="https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/pierre-bourdieu-cultural-capital-in-the-21st-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.</a></p>
<p>HR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects. <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/how-to-test-your-recruiting-strategy">I've suggested a simple way to do it.</a></p>
<p>Yet, there is simply no market, competitive, moral pressure to do so.</p>

<p>Business owners, shareholders, and job seekers think we are better off with them.</p>
<p>What people don't ask is how many of the problems the HR / recruitment industry solves are problems created by a bureacracy (that recruiters themselves are part of).</p>
<p>Example: employment rights, unions, protection of workers supposedly protect workers from unfair labor practices (Stockholm warning). But this also make it much harder for business owners to hire and fire employees, thus justifying the need for HR / recruiters.</p>
<p>The 2nd order effect is that business are less willing to hire and invest in employees, given that underperforming employees are so hard to let go.</p>
<p>I can't make the call that we are better off without labor regulations. But its important to understand the more complex we make labor laws, the more power HR and recruiters get.</p>
<p>At some point, job seekers lose and business owners lose.</p>

<p>Parasite is a strong word, but the classification is that it must grow infinitely at the expense of the host's strength. This is consistent with my observations. The Fed gets stronger everytime they print more money and do not hesitate to increase their personnel. Similarly, HR went from 0.5% workforce to 1.5% workforce from 1980 to 2020. In the same time with the growth of these institutions, their "customers" get weaker. This is unlike competitive economic systems (example Nvidia) where their growth is also followed by the growth in strength by their customers. <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-public#user-content-fnref-4-e68ca5" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>It's hard to be controversial to say so. Most people who worked and earned money for a living would be frustrated by the whole experience that is so embedded in modern society, to the point it becomes something we learned to be helpless about.</p>

<p>Modern money is all fiat, meaning it is not backed by anything. Not gold, not oil, just blind trust. Actually, it is backed by the power of military<sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/real-function-of-taxes#user-content-fn-2-4c6868" id="user-content-fnref-2-4c6868" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>, but we will leave the story to another day.</p>
<p>If we are to accept that money is not backed by anything, a state theoretically doesn't need to collect taxes before they spend -- they can just spend on what they want and pay it back later by raising taxes, or to do nothing and devalue all cash and savings.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-bother-collecting-taxes">"Why bother collecting taxes?"<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/real-function-of-taxes#why-bother-collecting-taxes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;Why bother collecting taxes?&quot;" title="Direct link to &quot;Why bother collecting taxes?&quot;">​</a></h3>
<p>Great question. The amount of effort it takes to collect taxes is enormous.</p>
<p>Using the US as an example (its the most available one to build my priors) <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/irs-tax-compliance-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the estimates of tax compliance cost of the $546 billion, or nearly 2 percent of GDP.</a></p>
<p>Annually, the US government raises <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17% of GDP as taxes</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, we are spending $15 for every $100 we harass a productive business to give the state.</p>
<p>This number includes taxes paid through active means (IRS audits) and passive means (taxes on income, VAT). If we are to estimate the cost of active collection and the actual tax revenue active collectors raised, it may be less than the cost it takes to finance active collectors.</p>
<p>It's like spending $100 on debt collectors (debt isn't even a right word as it implies we owe the state our production) to raise something less than $100.</p>
<p>If the objective of taxes is really to raise capital to afford projects, active collection seems ineffective at what they do.</p>
<p>Instead of answering why are we doing something inefficient, let's start with what happens if we just do nothing.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="case-1-really-doing-nothing">Case 1: Really doing nothing<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/real-function-of-taxes#case-1-really-doing-nothing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Case 1: Really doing nothing" title="Direct link to Case 1: Really doing nothing">​</a></h3>
<p>No government spending, no taxes, constant supply of money. The state is literally sleeping at the wheel.</p>
<p>Unrealistic scenario, but suppose this happens we should predict inflation to be 0%. This seems like a time when we have a perfect currency.</p>
<p>The problem is that the economy becomes perfectly competitive, which means those that earn will hold more currency and control a bigger share of the network (mercantilism).</p>
<p>The currency becomes less representative to those who are weaker or less competitive. With no state spending, there is no safety net except for private charities.</p>
<p>If people expect spending will cause them to lose power to sellers, then transactions are seen as zero-sum and the economy gets more illiquid.</p>
<p>Also, not having a state is really a bad idea, in the sense that markets become lawless. In practice what you'll end up getting is local mafias bullying businesses into giving them special privileges -- you don't pay taxes to the state, but you pay "taxes" to guys meaner than you. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/real-function-of-taxes#user-content-fn-5-4c6868" id="user-content-fnref-5-4c6868" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>State prints as much money as it wants, gives out as much to anyone who will vote for them. Never collects any of them back.</p>
<p>Sounds too good to be true. Now people stop producing because there is no reason to. When there is no production, all the money can't buy anything -- you have a hyperinflation situation.</p>
<p>There's more! When people expect the currency to get weaker, the network of producers becomes more reluctant to accept the currency -- people rather do a barter trade or keep good things for themselves than to take your currency.</p>

<p>The "perfect" scenario. The state spends as much as it wants to get something done, then get back all the money it spent back from people through taxes.</p>
<p>No net inflation, and stuff gets done! What's the problem?</p>

<p>There is a more perfect scenario -- stuff gets done, and people keep all the newly minted currency. If something valuable was already done, why waste energy to give back the catalyst (ie: the currency)?</p>
<p>The problem happens when the currency gets spent on more things than it was made to spend on (IE: buying labor for social services becomes salary to spend and compete on limited goods) -- Taxes ensures the velocity of created money is not infinite.</p>
<p>In practice people can always argue why they don't need to return the currency, so its hard to take back as much money as we created.</p>

<p>The state can create money to buy for things they want, but in practice you can bet the decisions aren't fair (IE: what the state wants to buy might not be what the people want to buy).</p>
<p>In fact, the state can just set up a shell company with their entourage, print some money and pay his friends and declaring his friends are being "paid to do social work". -- This is wastage in a nutshell.</p>
<p>In practice, things are not so blatant. Its more likely for state actors to set up lots of layers of agency that takes some cut of the budget, where the agency also happens to contain a share of the state's entourage -- also known as "deep state".</p>
<p>So a scenario with perfect balance sheet is not perfect if the work paid to do / things bought isn't representative.</p>

<p>If the state prints money to hire workers, then it means someone else would lose the worker they wanted to hire to do their work.</p>
<p>In a free market, the most important work gets done first and that is reflected by prices and bids.</p>
<p>When the state spends money, it is unclear if the work that needs to be done are the most important ones.</p>
<p>When suboptimal decisions are made and financed, in effect that is also a net loss to the people. It's like saying you win 10% doing something when you could have won 50% doing nothing -- a good outcome is not a valid defense for a good decision.</p>

<p>Notice the theme here. The state can do anything it wants, but its decisions must be sound (IE: logical, benefits the people, within budget).</p>
<p>A sound decision is one that is profitable. IE: You spend little to do a lot.</p>
<p>When the state does something suboptimal, the net effect is the people's standard of living will devalue because they:</p>
<ol>
<li>need to ask more taxes from the people to pay back what they spent.</li>
<li>print more money to pay back what they spent, creating inflation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In modern finance, taxes are paid so inflation does not happen.</strong></p>

<p>Great question. If the net effect of ineffective state spending is lower standards of living, and the way it is delivered can be either passive (through inflation) or active (through taxes), we could choose to do nothing.</p>
<p>Why go through all the hassle and trouble to feel pain?</p>
<p>I could write a whole post on how money works, how it flows. But the short answer I discovered after 20 years of studying money is: "it's all politics".</p>

<p>The reason why people think public spending is free money -- that voters consistently vote for money spending across any civilization -- I suspect has to do with "semantic deception".</p>
<p>If people really understood how public spending gets paid back, perhaps they wouldn't be so obsessed with the idea of "free money". The issue is that the sematics "public spending" gives people the idea that it is "money spent on the public", so we just ignored all the little things that happen behind the scenes.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am surrounded by independent thinkers.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am surrounded by independent thinkers. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-1-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-1-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>From this limited sampling, I learn that most of these independent thinkers had an episode of being misunderstood, disagreed, or ridiculed by the people around them.</p>
<p>Given that society generally prefers conformity, those who stand out or question the status quo are generally meet resistance from social exclusion to hostility.</p>
<p>This is also a common trope in anime, movies, videogames, pop content we consume -- where the protagonists are often portrayed as independent people who frequently invite opposition and antagonists.</p>
<p>We come to take for granted that this is just the way it is and think nothing about it. Perhaps its just a "main character syndrome", where everyone universally has the same experience of rejection, its just that only the survivors get to tell their story and the rest of us romanticize those misunderstandings and adversity.</p>
<p>This romanticization, while inspiring, obscures the fact that the experiences of independent people are not unique or extraordinary but rather a common consequence of their nonconformity.</p>
<p>I believe there is a structural reason why anyone who attempts to be independent will meet opposition and social challenges, and is very uncommon for independent people to be ignored or celebrated. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-2-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-2-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Simply because a conformist's reward function is to be agreed. If they ever get disagreed, they will just shift their ideas to what is conventionally accepted.</p>
<p>By sampling bias, it means deviants will experience 90% of all disagreements. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-5-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-5-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deviant-minds-are-easy-targets">Deviant minds are easy targets<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#deviant-minds-are-easy-targets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deviant minds are easy targets" title="Direct link to Deviant minds are easy targets">​</a></h2>
<p>A deviant often become easy targets for those seeking to enhance their social reputation.</p>
<p>Opposing the establishment, especially in fields like politics is a braindead strategy to gain attention and support.</p>
<p>For example, political candidates may rise to power simply by positioning themselves as opponents of the existing order, without necessarily offering substantial or innovative policies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZG95grO-vc&amp;ab_channel=Japanalysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The case of Tachibana Takeshi is a great illustration</a>. His political ascent was primarily fueled by his opposition to the NHK fee -- a stance that resonated with many who were dissatisfied with the status quo. However, once in power, it became evident that his strategy, politics, and philosophy lacked depth and he lost his momentum after "the dragon has been slain".</p>
<p>The point is "braindead opposition strategy" against any target that sticks out is very rewarding, and deviants unintentionally create opportunities for others to gain prominence by simply opposing them.</p>
<p>The act of contradicting a deviant is low-risk / high-reward behavior, making deviants easy targets for those seeking to elevate their own social standing.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="changing-minds-forces-people-to-reflect-on-weaknesses">Changing minds forces people to reflect on weaknesses<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#changing-minds-forces-people-to-reflect-on-weaknesses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Changing minds forces people to reflect on weaknesses" title="Direct link to Changing minds forces people to reflect on weaknesses">​</a></h2>
<p>Acting as a messenger of truth or promoting independent ideas is high risk. It is much simpler and less risky for individuals to conform to the majority opinion than to challenge it.</p>
<p>When deviants change people's minds, they encounter resistance because their message forces others to confront their own vulnerabilities or mistakes.</p>
<p>This can lead to defensive reactions, as individuals feel compelled to double down on their established positions to avoid appearing wrong.</p>
<p>This dynamic is even more obvious in institutional settings, where admitting the validity of an deviant's ideas means rejecting the institution they are part of -- it is an equivalent of being placed in an "ideological death ground" if one has a career or is dependent on the survival of the institution.</p>
<p>In cases of a person being placed in "death grounds", the pushback is desperate, regardless of how right a deviant's ideas are.</p>
<p>In most cases, the pushback is directed to the deviant itself, regardless of how much this antagonism is justified.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-is-inevitable-for-deviants-to-invite-trouble">It is inevitable for deviants to invite trouble<a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#it-is-inevitable-for-deviants-to-invite-trouble" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to It is inevitable for deviants to invite trouble" title="Direct link to It is inevitable for deviants to invite trouble">​</a></h2>
<p>So long as we have a social dynamic that rewards reputation and conformity, status consciousness becomes an investment with ROI. Then, being a deviant inherently invites trouble.</p>
<p>It is not that any individual personal have an issue against deviants -- most individuals would prefer interacting with a deviant over conformists.</p>
<p>However, the social system finds it easy to penalize deviants because status consciousness means some agent find their ranking and rewards threatened by uncommon behaviors. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-4-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-4-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The act of questioning norms or presenting alternative viewpoints disrupts the equilibrium and can threaten the reputation of those invested in maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>I'll argue that due to this dynamic, <strong>it is impossible for anyone to have true independent thinking unless they have complete detachment from status consciousness.</strong> <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-3-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-3-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-6-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-6-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-7-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-7-0f5506" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Deviants invite troubles because challenging the status quo disrupts social dynamics and threatens the reputation of those who benefit from the existing order.</p>
<p>The obstacles faced by deviants are not always personal and its more likely rooted in human nature and the structures of society.</p>
<p>While independence is crucial for innovation and progress, it comes at a cost that not everyone is willing or able to bear.</p>
<p>To all deviants: Don't be a drama queen and think everyone is out there to get you. Everyone is "out there to get you" because that is what people do. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fn-5-0f5506" id="user-content-fnref-5-0f5506-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Inversely, it could mean any person who experienced a chronic disagreements are more likely to see themselves as a deviant -- this is fallacy thinking.

<p>In cases of a group of people who don't compare with one another, you notice that independent behaviors don't meet as much rejections as these groups have no status games to play with one another. Since neither cares much about their own reputation, another person's action doesn't bring them any threat and you observe less "witch-hunting" behavior. <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fnref-4-0f5506" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>A simple observation is to observe artists and their behavior pre-fame and post-fame. An artist is an embodiment of independence. But anyone who observes an artist that rises to fame is that they become less controversial the more popular they are. If my theory is true, artists who gets less controversial become like that because they have more interest in developing status consciousness. <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fnref-3-0f5506" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>I expect pushback for saying this, but I think this reason also explains why creative women are less common than creative men. Women are more status conscious, so there is a disadvantage in the capacity to hold independent thoughts. That is not to say women are less creative -- a woman who is detached from status conscious are just as capable of being creative. Inversely, a man that is burdened by status-conscious will have as much trouble being creative. <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fnref-6-0f5506" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 6" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>This theory also support the observation that many great art in ancient history was done by non-hetero people (Michelangelo, Nikola Tesla). But as LGBTQ and DEI gathers more social momentum and subsequently more conformist, you see a decline in the quality of art produced by non-hetero people if they happen to be absorbed by the conformist movement (Snow White and Concord are the latest disasters). <a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles#user-content-fnref-7-0f5506" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 7" class="data-footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<p>There is no such thing as job security -- especially not in a role without craftsmanship -- without taking away freedom from future generations.</p>
<p>Why? Because most people's idea of "job security" requires them to be a high paying white-collar bureaucrat in an office with a big corner desk.</p>
<p>Who wants to have a secure job that needs you to deal with dirt, danger, difficulties? If you can handle those 3Ds I guarantee your career is secure 100%. Incidentally, those are the jobs people look forward the most to be replaced.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reality is not that there is "no job security", rather it is "there is not enough non-3D secure jobs" in this world, because each one requires a government or bureaucracy to print or devalue existing currency to keep you and your desk.</p>
<p>When everyone thinks they are entitled to that illusion, what do you think is going to happen to future generations?</p>
<p>Some people worked hard to get a cushy, secure job as a C-level in some corporate, public office, conglomerate, consultancy, education institution.</p>
<p>An average person will think the price is decades of hard work climbing the career ladder and dealing with occasional office politics -- it is not the only price paid.</p>
<p>If the job is an administrative role where the "ascension" requires building a wall to keep off competitors (EG: adding regulations, raising licensing requirements to limit labor supply), paper pushing (office equivalent of digging a hole then filling a hole), it may be complicit in making some of the younger generations less free in doing productive work and less free with their social mobility.</p>
<p>If you ever felt "credential inflation" and lower conversion rates in job application rates, this is what's happening and you have the market that existed before you to thank.</p>
<p>If you are still young and starting out in your career, stop buying the idea or complaining about job security -- it was never there.</p>
<p>If it was, then the (money printing and deficit spending) ship has sailed and you need to start making something for yourself.</p>
<p>Look up your state's public spending, learn how to read financial statements of companies, and learn how money and value is created. You will quickly come to conclusion the only way wealth can be created is to do something that helps people and do it better (IE: getting better at your craft).</p>
<p>Most office jobs today are "state manufactured elites". IE: the state lends money for someone to get into college, get in debt, then offers them to be a slave for the state.</p>
<p>It is as ridiculous as minting your own crypto, selling "scholarships" to players by borrowing them your axoloties, and sending those axolotl to battle as a chore. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/we-cant-afford-job-security#user-content-fn-1-a568d0" id="user-content-fnref-1-a568d0" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The difference is one does it with fictional currency. The other does it with printed or taxed money.</p>

<p>If you want real job security, you must accept 3Ds, or be so good at your craft that no one beats you at your game.</p>

<p>Logically, that can't be possible. But nothing in real life is perfectly logical. As engineers we need to diagnose and fix the problems.</p>
<p>In software, we have things like unit test, integrated test, system test.</p>
<p>As it complexity goes higher, we need live simulations, like hiring a game tester or setup Selenium to simulate a login process.</p>
<p>With the same philosophy, a company could hypothetically perform "recruiting test" that is really easy to do.</p>

<p>You waste months of life on a wrong hire. If your CEO picks up the phone just say congrats you done your work.</p>

<p>Everyone is using AI to generate their profiles already. They are also including as many frameworks (they are not even good at) as they can in resumes to hack the ATS keyword search.</p>
<p>Instead of investing on data science to figure out a better recruiting AI, use cheap data science to test your recruitment hit rate.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In any given business, the ideal state is that you can get away doing the least while creating the most outcome. In practice, idling looks like wasted cost, lost revenue. This philosophy is the result of us getting conditioned by centuries of economic model where labor time can be valued economically.</p>
<p>It is hard escaping being a victim to this hustling mentality, where simply believing that if one can put in more hours one would be achieving more -- this view get more wrong with every progress made to automation and technology.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I'm composing music, in any given moment not all instruments are busy playing their own notes, yet somehow they are still able to create an "effective symphony" with so little activity from each individual.</p>
<p>In fact, to achieve an effective symphony, it is necessary for pauses, emphasis, and passing spotlights to different parts and performers of the orchestra.</p>
<p>The best composers or conductors don't make everyone play all the time. When I was an amateur, I thought the requirement to be a good composer is complexity, difficulty, and novelty, yet I notice a lot of great composers can get away with composition that is simple to play (C-major), cliched progressions (4/4 time signature) (1-4-5-6 progression) and still hitting the top charts.</p>
<p>Inversely, a composition that is played by all parts of the orchestra constantly with complex maneuver are actually works done by an amateur. With the advent of digital music, it is now possible for composers to write in range and complexity that are impossible to perform.</p>
<hr>
<p>If difficulty and activity are signs of skill, then music topping the charts would have been electronic music with 10 instruments playing throughout the song at 200 BPM, with SFX automation clips stacked over one another. Clearly, the playlists we choose don't look like this.</p>
<p>Given the lack of correlation (that is continuing to decrease) between activity and outcome, somehow businesses and people who want to improve their personal career are still stuck with the mindset that "activity &gt;&gt; outcome".</p>
<p>Somehow, it is unacceptable for any employee to not have a backlog full of events. It is shameful to be seen by your friends that you don't have a full schedule one month ahead of you. You look like a loser if you don't have anything going on during your weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>Ask any artist, software developer, writer that is competent, and they always seem to arrive to the same answer-- effective emptiness, blanks, and space is required in a finished good product.</p>
<p>I think management and hustlers have a lot to learn from these people.</p>]]></content>

<p>A leader should spend all their time creating and engineering a better future. Speculating on markets outside their expertise should be a waste of time if they really know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Even lower confidence if I peeked at their portfolio and notice them losing trades on speculative assets. Is that the reason why my boss urgently needs money and productivity?</p>
<p>There are some exceptions, where a great investor is also doing the hands-on work of running a company. <sup><a href="https://neldivad.github.io/blog/ineffective-leaders#user-content-fn-1-747160" id="user-content-fnref-1-747160" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If an employee is a problem and you can do without them, terminate. Don't need to threaten.</p>
<p>If you must threaten, intimidation is a poor strategy to motivate someone who is underperforming or misbehaving -- a leader that makes a poor strategy is a poor leader.</p>
<p>What happens when you threaten is resentment and people preparing to jump ship as soon as they find the opportunity. Bad retention strategy.</p>
<p>Roll for persuasion, not intimidation.</p>

<p>By showing up late, or keeping people overtime on projects or meetings.</p>
<p>Usually, this behavior is confounded with regular poor business judgment.</p>
<p>They tend to have budget issues and lack of manpower issues, but I hypothesize the true cause is that they cannot properly allocate priorities.</p>

<p>You don't build a sports team that wins by buying players at wholesale prices. Lots of people do it, but I haven't seen one that works.</p>
<p>If someone really had a good solution to your problem, you pay as much as you can to get it.</p>
<p>Underpaying and cost-cutting is also a behavior that's confounded with priority issues similar to (3).</p>
<p>Underpaying, while it works against workers who are desperate enough to put up with those conditions, also has the effect of hiding the real costs of the problem.</p>
<p>Leaders will take for granted that this is all the investment that needs to get things done (at unsustainable prices) and think they have margins to pursue even worse market ideas.</p>
<p>You don't win from someone's losses by lowballing. You also lose out on real information that would have stopped you from pursuing bad ideas.</p>
