This one is on me. 

<!--truncate-->

Seems like bad things happen in succession. I don't want to demoralize anyone reading this, so I'll just keep it short and as an update. 

My back hurts because I'm sitting too much. 

This sucks because it means that I won't be able to work as much as I've did in the past, and likely never will be able to.

It also doesn't look like the work I do is getting any traction, so hard work is decreasingly an option for me -- I need ideas that scale.

## What it means for you
### Partners
If you're one of my partners, the plans don't change -- I'll get better over a few days. 

The volume of things I will agree to do in the future will decrease though. 

Labor intensive tasks like studio recording work will also be less of a solo work. I may need to afford a helper for some of those task in the future. 

### Just visiting
Don't feel bad. Things just happen and health is one of them. If I'm lucky, a few gym sessions will bring back my physical health.

If this is a more long-term thing, it means I've exhausted the competitive advantage of hard-work and grinding for this lifetime -- I need to find a more scalable way to get things done profitably. 

Worst case, it's only going to take off 20% of my screen time, so I don't grieve over this loss.

Take care of yourself out there.
