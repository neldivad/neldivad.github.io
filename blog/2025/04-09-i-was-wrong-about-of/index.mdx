At the end of 2023, I was autistic enough to count the stats of a popular career choice of a demographic. It was just a fun hobby I did with my friends.

**TLDR**: The estimation is 4%, and I hypothesize that with that number of competitors its not a viable or profitable career choice given my estimations of the market and more people should look to exit that market.

Fast forward to 2025, someone did the actual math.

The final number comes to 8% -- 2X my estimation. I don't know if I should be proud of how generous I am, or be ashamed of how wrong I am.

Its not my place to tell anyone what is the right thing to do. I'm just impressed by the math and information. 

Have fun with it.
