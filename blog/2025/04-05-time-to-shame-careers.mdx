People shame other people for having a job. It's as if having a job is a signal that someone is there not due to their own choice, and is a slave to the market's demands. 

Inversely, careers is something we socially look up to. As if your life was granted meaning and validated socially because it is a career.

I think it's irrational, especially when you find out how most careers come to be financed, sustained, and also the value that was created by "careers".

## WTF is a career?
A career is more than a job -- its a calling to do something that it is your "identity". 

Problem is, most careers are not productive. Somehow it's an identity that commands respect? 

Many adults taught me to not have a job, but to have a career. I'm sure many people heard the same. Perhaps the original intention is to motivate and inspire me to have ambitions and not to settle on doing someone's chores. 

But a short contemplation will realize that not everyone is going to have a career -- simply because there are certain way of life that just isn't fun, is a pain to do, that has to be done or else things falls apart. 

### Examples productive careers 
If a career is your "calling" to do something that genuinely creates value, fine. That's rare, though. 

This is because an actually "productive" career functions like a "job" -- you do it because it has to be done, or someone needs it done. 

Example, cleaning / fixing things so bad things doesn't happen. Or entrepreneurs who has to keep building things to grow wealth for other people. Or an artist who has to keep writing and creating because he has a lot to say -- that needs to be heard. 

Most of these examples don't start out as an aspiration. It is more like a "job" that people do because they have to, or because they are the best person to do it and have to rise up to that duty. 

The prestige of these "careers" typically comes much, much later -- when someone got enough things done to the point it has became their identity, and that quitting that role means less good stuff will happen without them. 

Before they had the "career", it was often a job that was ridiculed -- No one cares about any business owner and what they do when their ARR was under $10k. 

Even artist's who supposedly does "fun stuff" spends 90% of their time on "chores" -- doing boring practicing, thought organizing, coming up with a good story. 


### Examples of unproductive careers
What's more common is someone clinging to a title that makes them feel important, funded by systems that punish others.

When someone "wants a career" and not a "job", there seems to be a gravity to a few ideas they typically try to go for. IDK if its because its easier, less risky, or due to the social engineering that elevates such role to get all these artificial demand to perform. 

On closer inspection, many of these "high-demand careers" are functionally not far away from a bureaucrat.[^1]

[^1]: Most "careers" are professional theater -- long meetings with little consequence, made-up KPIs, internal awards, and endless PowerPoints that exist just to impress other PowerPoint makers. I've been there, and AFAIK academia, big consulting, big banks is just a more expensive version of college with more drama. 

Take politics and bureaucracy -- entire ecosystems of people paid to administrate, regulate, delay, and inflate. 

Every promotion is a reward for mastering inefficiency, not solving it.  And every "public service" is funded by inflating the cost of living for everyone else and infuriating people with inconvenient rules.

If you ask any impressionable and naive young person what their ideal career is, very often they will describe something that is functionally indistinguishable from a bureaucrat. 

The fact that no "career politician" ever gets anything important done is a sign that careers as a concept and as a social demand is a burden paid by other people to fund a person's office lifestyle. 

The best politicians are the ones who treat power as a job, and retires as soon as the job is done.

## Seriously, we should make fun of careers

Careers get status. Jobs get condescension. 

But jobs -- real jobs -- actually respond to demand. A guy fixing your pipes is doing more tangible good for society than a "strategic synergy executive."

Weâ€™ve glamorized career paths that have no intrinsic necessity. They exist because we printed money, inflated prestige, and sold dreams to impressionable and indoctrinated young people.

What most people mean by "career" is a kind of fake email job -- subsidized by central banks and taxpayer bloat. A lifestyle of Slack messages, Zoom fatigue, and workplace politics. 

Somehow this is prestigious.

Somehow this is aspirational.

Somehow *this* is the conversation starter at bars: "So what do you do?"  

Somehow this is worth giving up the basic life of falling in love, sleeping, eating, and living with a family. 

The tragedy is that the people doing difficult, thankless, necessary work -- the parents, the builders, the artists, the caretakers, the problem solvers -- they get less status than someone who schedules stakeholder alignment meetings all week.

We normalized a lie. That a "career" equals virtue, meaning, or impact.

In truth, most careers are curated performances in artificial systems, and most jobs are hard-won decisions to carry burdens others can't or won't.

One of them deserves honor.

The other deserves audit.

## "Wallahi what am I gonna do?" 
Jobs are inevitable. Someone always have something that needs to be taken care of. 

If there are no problems, then look for something that can grow. Anything that is worth growing will start demanding enough out of you to the point it becomes a chore, a job, an indispensable action that you can't not do else the growth will stop, good things stop happening, or bad things start happening. 

To use a more relatable example, being a parent is not a career -- it is a job. You do it so you can raise someone into becoming useful, productive, independent, and happy. 

Also, the stakes of you failing your job is very high. This is your modus operandi of why you do and who you are -- and you think this boring labor of being someone's parent is worth all your time. 

A parent that functions like a career is more like a narcissist with a project.

Who post about the kid's milestones for likes, treat parenting choices like corporate branding, fashion, and obsess over being seen as a "good parent" rather than raising a good human.

Their kid is their product, their home a PR campaign. They are less interested in what the child needs and more focused on how it reflects on them. Their kids will be gay or trans [^2] if it helps them rank better in their friendship circles. 

[^2]: Why are you gae? So who is gae? 

One of those parents are what we need, while the other is just glorified for engaging in unprotected sex.
