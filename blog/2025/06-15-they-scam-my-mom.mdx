I'm getting old enough to experience my mother getting approached by pseudoscience health scam. Here is how my mother spent RM2310 behind my back.

If I have to name all of the scams that I've been exposed to, I'll be ashamed. In fact, there is a lot of risk announcing that you've been scammed.

If you've never seen a scam from the inside, it's disturbingly professional. Get scammed once, and the whole network activates. 

New contacts, new calls, new products. They move fast. Faster than most startups. Their CRM game is so tight, it makes venture-backed fulfillment pipelines look like amateurs.

They don't just sell. They swarm. And you'll go broke buying stupid overpriced shit in no time.

## The Scam 
I don't know when this happened, but it was done behind my back. My mother needs to be a very proud person to not share her judgement and her contact with the scammer with me for that long. 

### Scam: Bioplasm Non-Linear Systems
These scams don't happen online. They come **directly to your home**. Here's the playbook:

1. **Direct selling with psychological pressure**  
   They visit your home personally, often bringing other team members or even family members to create a sense of **bandwagon trust** or **subtle intimidation**.  

2. **Weird devices, big promises**  
   You're asked to wear something that looks like a **high-tech headphone**, which they claim can scan your entire body: organs, tissues, everything, just from brainwaves.

3. **Technobabble theatre**  
   They sit you down for >20 minutes to watch a **scripted “report” video** filled with complex graphs, body scans, and medical-sounding jargon. The goal is to **overload your imagination** with "problems" only their "upsells" can solve.


**Example of Technobabble**

> “A headphone-like device scans your brainwaves to determine the health of all your organs.”

Sounds futuristic, right? But let's look at the actual science:
- EEG (electroencephalography) **only measures brain activity** — it can detect things like sleep, seizures, or head trauma.
- There is **no scientific method** for using EEG to scan distant organs like your liver or pancreas.
- To scan internal organs, doctors use:
  - **MRI** (magnetic fields),
  - **CT** (X-rays),
  - **Ultrasound** (high-frequency sound).

## Reflections
If I have to reflect how I could've avoided this outcome, I'm not sure how to do that. 

My mother needs not to be embarrassed to share her judgment with me, and she needs to trust me enough to consult me on the matter. But the prerequisite must be that she is not condescending to her children's judgment. 

You can blame yourself for not having a better relationship with your parent, and that this is the "cost" of not having a good communication.  

But a blood relationship is complex. Not everything can be logically reasoned.

If your parent is anyone reasonable and is able to let go of their ego and shame from the experience, you should talk about it and settle an agreement instead of being resentful with each other.

If your parent is a serial bad decision maker, you may have to resort to a more aggressive approach in limiting your parent's freedom in contact or spending.
