I am surrounded by independent thinkers. [^1]

[^1]: if you can't see what I did there, I'm disappointed. 

From this limited sampling, I learn that most of these independent thinkers had an episode of being misunderstood, disagreed, or ridiculed by the people around them.

Given that society generally prefers conformity, those who stand out or question the status quo are generally meet resistance from social exclusion to hostility.

This is also a common trope in anime, movies, videogames, pop content we consume -- where the protagonists are often portrayed as independent people who frequently invite opposition and antagonists. 

We come to take for granted that this is just the way it is and think nothing about it. Perhaps its just a "main character syndrome", where everyone universally has the same experience of rejection, its just that only the survivors get to tell their story and the rest of us romanticize those misunderstandings and adversity. 

This romanticization, while inspiring, obscures the fact that the experiences of independent people are not unique or extraordinary but rather a common consequence of their nonconformity.

I believe there is a structural reason why anyone who attempts to be independent will meet opposition and social challenges, and is very uncommon for independent people to be ignored or celebrated. [^2] 

[^2]: There are cases of really autistic people who are independent, can do their own thing competently, and cannot perceive the negativity or oppositions conjured by others. While such obliviousness means they are not held back by public opinion, it is still more probable their work meets more resistance relative to support.

## A conformist can't be disagreed

Simply because a conformist's reward function is to be agreed. If they ever get disagreed, they will just shift their ideas to what is conventionally accepted. 

By sampling bias, it means deviants will experience 90% of all disagreements. 

## Deviant minds are easy targets
A deviant often become easy targets for those seeking to enhance their social reputation. 

Opposing the establishment, especially in fields like politics is a braindead strategy to gain attention and support. 

For example, political candidates may rise to power simply by positioning themselves as opponents of the existing order, without necessarily offering substantial or innovative policies.

[The case of Tachibana Takeshi is a great illustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZG95grO-vc&ab_channel=Japanalysis). His political ascent was primarily fueled by his opposition to the NHK fee -- a stance that resonated with many who were dissatisfied with the status quo. However, once in power, it became evident that his strategy, politics, and philosophy lacked depth and he lost his momentum after "the dragon has been slain". 

The point is "braindead opposition strategy" against any target that sticks out is very rewarding, and deviants unintentionally create opportunities for others to gain prominence by simply opposing them. 

The act of contradicting a deviant is low-risk / high-reward behavior, making deviants easy targets for those seeking to elevate their own social standing.

## Changing minds forces people to reflect on weaknesses
Acting as a messenger of truth or promoting independent ideas is high risk. It is much simpler and less risky for individuals to conform to the majority opinion than to challenge it. 

When deviants change people's minds, they encounter resistance because their message forces others to confront their own vulnerabilities or mistakes.

This can lead to defensive reactions, as individuals feel compelled to double down on their established positions to avoid appearing wrong. 

This dynamic is even more obvious in institutional settings, where admitting the validity of an deviant's ideas means rejecting the institution they are part of -- it is an equivalent of being placed in an "ideological death ground" if one has a career or is dependent on the survival of the institution. 

In cases of a person being placed in "death grounds", the pushback is desperate, regardless of how right a deviant's ideas are. 

In most cases, the pushback is directed to the deviant itself, regardless of how much this antagonism is justified. 


## It is inevitable for deviants to invite trouble
So long as we have a social dynamic that rewards reputation and conformity, being a deviant inherently invites trouble.

It is not typically a personal vendetta against deviants. Rather, it is a systemic response to the challenges they pose to the existing social order. 

The act of questioning norms or presenting alternative viewpoints disrupts the equilibrium and can threaten the reputation of those invested in maintaining the status quo.

I'll argue that due to this dynamic, **it is impossible for anyone to have true independent thinking unless they have complete detachment from social approvals.** [^3]

[^3]: A simple observation is to observe artists and their behavior pre-fame and post-fame. An artist is an embodiment of independence. But anyone who observes an artist that rises to fame is that they become less controversial the more popular they are. If my theory is true, artists who gets less controversial become like that because they have an attachment to social approvals.

## TLDR

Deviants invite troubles because challenging the status quo disrupts social dynamics and threatens the reputation of those who benefit from the existing order. 

The obstacles faced by deviants are not always personal and its more likely rooted in human nature and the structures of society. 

While independence is crucial for innovation and progress, it comes at a cost that not everyone is willing or able to bear. 

To all deviants: Don't be a drama queen and think everyone is out there to get you. Everyone is "out there to get you" because that is what people do. 

Get over it.
