If you understand government budgets, you will stop believing in job security.

<!-- truncate -->

There is no such thing as job security -- especially not in a role without craftsmanship -- without taking away freedom from future generations. 

Why? Because most people's idea of "job security" requires them to be a high paying white-collar bureaucrat in an office with a big corner desk. 

Who wants to have a secure job that needs you to deal with dirt, danger, difficulties? If you can handle those 3Ds I guarantee your career is secure 100%. Incidentally, those are the jobs people look forward the most to be replaced. 

Therefore, the reality is not that there is "no job security", rather it is "there is not enough non-3D secure jobs" in this world, because each one requires a government or bureaucracy to print or devalue existing currency to keep you and your desk. 

When everyone thinks they are entitled to that illusion, what do you think is going to happen to future generations? 

Some people worked hard to get a cushy, secure job as a C-level in some corporate, public office, conglomerate, consultancy, education institution. 

An average person will think the price is decades of hard work climbing the career ladder and dealing with occasional office politics -- it is not the only price paid. 

If the job is an administrative role where the "ascension" requires building a wall to keep off competitors (EG: adding regulations, raising licensing requirements to limit labor supply), paper pushing (office equivalent of digging a hole then filling a hole), it may be complicit in making some of the younger generations less free in doing productive work and less free with their social mobility. 

If you ever felt "credential inflation" and lower conversion rates in job application rates, this is what's happening and you have the market that existed before you to thank. 

If you are still young and starting out in your career, stop buying the idea or complaining about job security -- it was never there. 

If it was, then the (money printing and deficit spending) ship has sailed and you need to start making something for yourself. 

Look up your state's public spending, learn how to read financial statements of companies, and learn how money and value is created. You will quickly come to conclusion the only way wealth can be created is to do something that helps people and do it better (IE: getting better at your craft). 

Most office jobs today are "state manufactured elites". IE: the state lends money for someone to get into college, get in debt, then offers them to be a slave for the state. 

It is as ridiculous as minting your own crypto, selling "scholarships" to players by borrowing them your axoloties, and sending those axolotl to battle as a chore. [^1]

The difference is one does it with fictional currency. The other does it with printed or taxed money.

If you want real job security, you must accept 3Ds, or be so good at your craft that no one beats you at your game.
