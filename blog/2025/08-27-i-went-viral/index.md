Recently, I went viral for a shitpost. 

It got more than 10x views than every other stuff I published cumulatively. 

Most of the stuff I ever made was ignored. Engagements never take off, and only the 2-5 moots that stuck with me for years reads it.

Some people repost my stuff and got even greater success for themselves -- its a memetic moment.

## Yeah, who cares? 

I don't care. [But I got permabanned from LinkedIn](https://x.com/nelvOfficial/status/1962765559998955955). So I need a way to insure my content.

## WTF? 
Yeaah, I have the same reaction as you. 

## What now? 
Just bookmark my blog. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nelvOfficial), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/divadlen/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nelvOfficial) 

LinkedIn really is a humorless platform. There's a reason why no one tries to be real.

## What else?
I will write more about my experience lessons from this temporary virality in the future, including how I think one should go about reengineering this moment [^1]. 

[^1]: The fact that it worked for me isn't important -- it is even reposters getting better results that speaks volume about the stickiness of the format, luck of the timing, etc. 

Also, the reaction and opportunities I've been getting from the public, and how I dealt with the traffic plus negativity. 

If this wasn't done after a while, remind me by DMing me on Twitter.
