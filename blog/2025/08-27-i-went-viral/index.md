Recently, I went viral for a shitpost. 

It got more than 10x views than every other stuff I published cumulatively. 

Most of the stuff I ever made was ignored. Engagements never take off, and only the 2-5 moots that stuck with me for years reads it.

Some people repost my stuff and got even greater success for themselves -- its a memetic moment.

## Yeah, who cares? 

I don't care. But I got suspended from LinkedIn. So I need a way to insure my content.

## WTF? 
Yeaah, I have the same reaction as you. 

## What now? 
Just bookmark my blog. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nelvOfficial), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/divadlen/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nelvOfficial) 

LinkedIn really is a humorless platform. There's a reason why no one tries to be real.
