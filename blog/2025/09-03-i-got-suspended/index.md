Some people just don't like other people to have fun. 

Here's proof that I got suspended from LinkedIn.

## WTF
Honestly, I wasn't even planning to show off that I got viral. I think it's a trivial achievement. 

However, after getting deplatformed within a week, I thought I needed more insurance in the future. If not for myself, then for my audience. 

## What now?

Just bookmark my blog. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nelvOfficial), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/divadlen/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nelvOfficial)

I'll be creating a tag [i dont think you understand](tags/i-dont-think-you-understand) for all of my past and future shit posts.
