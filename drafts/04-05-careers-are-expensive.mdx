People shame other people for having a job. It's as if having a job is a signal that someone is there not due to their own choice, and is a slave to the market's demands. 

Inversely, careers is something we socially look up to. As if your life was granted meaning and validated socially because it is a career.

I think it's irrational, especially when you find out how most careers come to be financed, sustained, and also the value that was created by most "careers".

## WTF is a job/career?
A career is more than a job -- its a calling to do something that it is your "identity".

Many adults taught me to not have a job but to have a career. I'm sure many people heard the same. Perhaps the original intention is to motivate and inspire me to have ambitions and not to settle on doing someone's chores. 

But a short contemplation will realize that not everyone is going to have a career -- simply because there are certain way of life that just isn't fun, is a pain to do, that has to be done or else things falls apart. 

In this article's context, a "job" is something that needs to be done, or that it was a task done by the "best person available". 

The latter description often gets confused with "career". Example, a Youtuber who shares lifehacks for brushing a cat -- (1) No one asks for it to be done, (2) it has became part of the Youtuber's identity, so it could be known as "career" under most modern semantics. 

However, when it turns out that the Youtuber ends up assuming the role of a cat-brushing expert, it becomes a "job" that needs to be done. 

**The keyword is that the thing that was done has a "market demand".**

Tasks and identity with no market demand are considered "self-congratulatory careers" and not "jobs". 



### Examples of productive careers 
If a career is your "calling" to do something that genuinely creates value, fine. That's rare, though. 

This is because an actually "productive" career functions like a "job" -- you do it because it has to be done, or someone needs it done. 

Example, cleaning / fixing things so bad things doesn't happen. Or entrepreneurs who has to keep building things to grow wealth for other people. Or an artist who has to keep writing and creating because he has a lot to say -- that wants to be heard. 

Most of these examples don't start out as an aspiration. It is more like a "job" that people do because they have to, or because they are the best person to do it and have to rise up to that duty. 

The prestige of these "careers" typically comes much, much later -- when someone got enough things done to the point it has became their identity, and that quitting that role means less good stuff will happen without them. 

Before they had the "career", it was often a job that was ridiculed -- No one cares about any business owner and what they do when their ARR was under $10k. 

Even artist's who supposedly does "fun stuff" spends 90% of their time on "chores" -- doing boring practicing, thought organizing, coming up with a good story. 


### Examples of unproductive careers
When someone "wants a career" and not a "job", there seems to be a gravity to a few ideas they typically try to go for. IDK if its because its easier, less risky, or due to the social engineering that elevates such role to get enough artificial demand to perform. 

If you ask any impressionable and naive young person what their ideal career is, very often they will describe something that is functionally indistinguishable from a bureaucrat. [^1]

[^1]: Most "careers" are professional theater -- long meetings with little consequence, made-up KPIs, internal awards, and endless PowerPoints that exist just to impress other PowerPoint makers. I've been there, and AFAIK academia, big consulting, big banks is just a more expensive version of college with more drama. 

You will also often find that these high-demand "careers" [^2] come with very impressive sounding titles. The more impressive the title sounds, the more useless it is in function. 

[^2]: These careers are high demand because they have a cushy, low-risk environment. Often, they are financed with guaranteed income, using currency printed by the state. There is also a psyop that shape the public narrative that the task is associated with an "elite identity", or other non-adminstrative task is associated with an "inferior identity". Example: office secretary vs housewife -- one of it creates more objective value than the other, but the status is inversely related due to psyops reasons. The way to correct this perception is to call out the emperor without clothes.  

Take politics and bureaucracy -- entire ecosystems of people paid to administrate, regulate, delay, and inflate. 

Many promotions observed is a reward for mastering inefficiency, not solving it. Most public services is funded by inflating the cost of living for everyone else and infuriating people with inconvenient rules.

Empirical observation will note that almost no "career politician" ever gets anything important done, and should be taken as a sign that "careers in administration" as a concept and as a social demand is a burden paid by other people to fund a person's office lifestyle. [^3] 

[^3]: The easy way to tell if someone is a career politician is if they are from the 2nd generation onwards (IE: was their parents or family a politician?). If a politician really is there for a job that needs to be done, and was really effective at getting the problem solved, **the probability of there to be a neccesity for their children to inherit their office is very low**. Following this logic, it will not be surprising that "career politicians" are necessarily useless. You can also use the same logic to judge that "investment firms" with really pretty looking secretaries necessarily underperform (if they are that good, why would they need to hire an attrative front?). 

The best politicians are the ones who treat power as a job, and retires as soon as the job is done. [^4]

[^4]: This concept relates to Nassim Nicholas Taleb - "Via Negativa". More precisely, "bullshit detection via negative signaling". (1) A politician who solves real problems creates no dynasty bc their job obsoletes itself. (2) A fund that performs doesn’t need "decorative staff" to attract clients. (3) The need to signal competence is inversely correlated with actual competence. To relate back to our topic, a "glamorized, high-demand career" is necessarily useless and expensive for society. (Entrepreneurship and artist is "high-demand" in word, but not in practice because it is too damn hard and lonely for most people)

## Self-congratulatory careers needs more ridicule

The reason why we get so many self-congratulatory careers is because we print money, inflate prestige, and sell dreams to impressionable and indoctrinated young people. By pretending the naked emperor wears clothes, we end up in a situation where careers get status, jobs get condescension. 

But jobs "are" jobs because they actually respond to a market demand. A guy fixing your pipes is doing more tangible good for society than a "strategic synergy executive."

A role with no market demand is a self-congratulatory career. 

:::info "But lawyers, adminstrators, politicians get paid more than jobs! Thats 'market demand'!"
:::

We’ve glamorized career paths that have no intrinsic necessity. They exist because we printed money, inflated prestige, and sold dreams to impressionable and indoctrinated young people. 

Real "market demand" happens when normal people want to buy that service / product. 

Fake "market demand" happens when service / product is bought by State Nanny, or was forced to be bought by normal people by State Nanny (EG: taxes). 

The "careers" that are understood by most people today is a kind of fake email job -- subsidized by central banks and taxpayer bloat. A lifestyle of Slack messages, Zoom fatigue, and workplace politics. 

Somehow this is prestigious.

Somehow this is aspirational.

Somehow *this* is the conversation starter at bars: "So what do you do?"  

Somehow this is worth giving up the basic life of falling in love, sleeping, eating, and living with a family. 

The reason we take this understanding for granted is a result of a **century-long psyop done by central banks who print money to hire adminstrators while taxing wealth producers and independents.** 

> "Show me the incentives and I will show you the outcome" -- Charlie Munger

This is how we end up in a civilization that people doing difficult, thankless, necessary work -- the parents, the builders, the artists, the caretakers, the problem solvers -- get less status than someone who schedules stakeholder alignment meetings all week.

We normalized a lie. That a "career" equals virtue, meaning, or impact. In truth, most careers are curated performances in artificial systems, and most jobs are hard-won decisions to carry burdens others can't or won't.

One of them deserves honor.

The other deserves audit.

With most public debt in most civilization at ATH, with debt/GDP near 100%, and with birthrates below replacement rate -- the emperor has no clothes.

## "Wallahi what am I gonna do?" 
Jobs are inevitable. Someone always have something that needs to be taken care of. 

If there are no problems, then look for something that can grow. **Anything that is worth growing will start demanding enough out of you to the point it becomes a chore, a job, an indispensable action that you can't not do** else the growth will stop, good things stop happening, or bad things start happening. 

To use a more relatable example, being a parent is not a career -- it is a job. Your modus operandi is to raise someone into becoming useful, productive, independent, and happy. 

Also, the stakes of you failing your job is very high, but its still why you do and who you are -- and you think this boring labor of being someone's parent is worth all your time. 

A parent that functions like a career is more like a narcissist with a project -- who post about the kid's milestones for likes, treat parenting choices like corporate branding, fashion, and obsess over being seen as a "good parent" rather than raising a good human.

Their kid is their product, their home a PR campaign. They are less interested in what the child needs and more focused on how it reflects on them. Their kids will own a certain identity [^5] if it helps them rank better in their friendship circles. 

[^5]: Controversy alert! I'll leave you with the imagination of what those identities could be.

One of those parents are what we need, while the other is just glorified for engaging in unprotected sex.
