It might be too early for me to write about this topic. 

I don't know who is going to read this post -- it could be my employees, contracted partners, future sponsors, strangers, fans of my work. 

<!--truncate--> 

There is a chance this post will not age well. In some likelihood, I may suffer negative consequences than positive ones being transparent about this information. It could also be interpreted as a "virtue signaling" or "self-promotion" post. 

That said, I'm still writing this to remind myself and to hold myself accountable to every person I'm working with -- that they can point me back to this post if there is a way to get a better deal for both of us.

## What is the risk of being too generous? 
### Less margins
Obviously, you keep less profits. It takes longer for you to be profitable. You have to work harder. 

### You lose the carrot on the stick 
One way to keep someone working for you perpertually is to keep them in a position where they can't get out -- paying them just enough to keep them working. 

If you are too generous, they will gain independence, find a new valuation for themselves, and then you will lose them when the market outbids them from you. 

### You have less negotiation leverage
If an employee / business partner gets better margin than you, you will sooner be "margin called" from your position and forced to take the worse side of a bad trade. 

Your competitors can also guess your budget and outbid your partners long enough until you burn out working everything on your own. 

### You only have enough margins to work with that many people
When you have cheap employees lining up for you, they can be disposable. A better way to put it is you get to have more options when things don't work out your way. 

If you are too generous, or if your partners know you are paying as much as you can, they can guess that they are not as disposable to you. A Machiavellian person might use this information to your disadvantage, like delaying deliveries, raising prices. 

However, in later sections I think this signal can result in more positive working relationship. (IE: it's better to you that your partners know they are not disposable to you)

## "I think its fine..."

### Most artists are broke, and its better if they have more 
Not surprising here. Making art is expensive, requires a lot of dedication, have very sparse market, and transactions take a long time to close. 

In many markets, knowing someone is "broke" is a golden opportunity to squeeze more profit out of them -- this is known as "terms of trade". People with better ToT are in the position to ask for a better deal at the expense of the other. 

That said, most artists perform substantially better when they don't have to think about finances. I want my partner to spend their time thinking about the project and their vision, not how to save money for their lunch. 

### The majority of the cost is in transactions anyway
Working together with an artist is not like an employee. You need to find someone with the same vision, have similar level skills to complement each other work, speak in same languages, have a similar level of motivation to keep working, and chances are you will both be on your own way after each project. 

This means of every 10-50 artists you procure, you only get to work with 1 of them. For most artists who does their work seriously, time is a scarce resource they don't have. (I'm also an artist with little time to spare). 

What you don't pay for money, you pay with time and energy that won't be used to create good work. [^1] Speaking of good work...

[^1]: I'm always bothered by corporates who rather spend $200-500 on job ads over raising salaries of existing employees by $100-200. (You are not angry enough if you haven't found out how much it costs to list a job ad, onboard a new person, and paying all the admin fees). After spending enough time in those places, I realize that many corporates at not maximizing profit, rather they are maximizing control -- for all of the reasons I've shared on the "Risk of generosity".  


### Most of us are here to do good work, not to get rich 
If someone wants to get rich, they wouldn't be doing art for years. They would be doing something else. 

By that filter, those who can stick to the process of creating for years necessarily want to do good work as long as its cashflow positive for them. 

Of course, a Machiavellian person might use this information to their advantage by squeezing as much margins off artists -- knowing they have little options and still have a strong desire to express their ego/vision. 

I think I have the choice to use this information differently -- that if I pay my partners as much as I can, I'm getting the most out of their work, and that they are sharing their best expression / vision. 

### I will have less money to do stupid shit
I've worked with too many people who ended up doing stupid shit because I saved them too much money (by charging too little, or too efficient at my job relative to my price). 

The frustrating thing is that those stupid shit wouldn't have happened if I had to be paid more because they couldn't have the cash to afford pursing those stupid ideas. Ironically, **being paid less means I've enabled someone to be a less accountable leader.** 

I once worked with a guy who has enough money to waste his time and money on real estate, stock speculation, and a masters degree when he should be running the company and getting sales. Not surprisingly, I didn't have a good exit working with him. If I priced him more, he would be forced to work harder on the business, which would be better for him and me in hindsight. 

Consequently...

### My partners have more interest in my success
They will yell at me for spending money on stupid shit (like useless ads) because it means I may pay them less. 

They will also come up with good business plans so I stay solvent or everyone goes home broke. 

On a related note, since this strategy leaves me with little margins to afford many options, it also **signals to my partners that they are the few and best people I want to have.** 

This filters out the Machiavellian people who would try to maximize their profit at everyone's expense. 


### If I pay more, everyone else gets paid more 
If I pay more, people will need to bid higher to get their services. There will be less people lowballing or squeezing margins off artists, and many of them can spend more time on their work instead of practicing their defense against aggressive contracts. This is a direct way of increasing the TAM of the art market. 

Someone who is into economics might disagree with this approach -- that the market price for anything should be as low as it can get, and those who can't survive will be forced to do other things, and the efforts of overpaying are futile if it lowers the bar for sellable art. 

I don't think that is what is going to happen. Most artists just needed a little bit more push and encouragement to get a better work, and money is the best way to validate their work over likes and attention. 

Also, in a perfect competition, everyone starves and work at 0% margin, and the supply of art will be constant. The bar might not be raised at all from all these competition because every artists who quits means the competitive market has destroyed years of preparation and practice. 

Cheap art will have a perception of "commodity", and will not command its true prestige as markets will take for granted of what it is -- human psychology is weird that we value things more if we spent more.

## What's in it for me? 
Seriously it would be too funny if I don't have good results, I became insolvent as an artist, while this article is still left out for the public to see. 

My optimism would have failed and people use it as an evidence to go back to the dark, Machiavellian ways of doing business. 

There is nothing for me, except to signal to my partners that I'm earnest and serious about my work with them.
