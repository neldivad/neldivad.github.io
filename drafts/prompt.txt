I want you to return a polished version of my original markdown. 

Do not summarize the article.

You are to simulate the reading experience of a person who has never read the article before and try to challenge the author's point and facts. 

If you have a place you wish to challenge or a place to include citations, add <!-- {context} --> after the paragraph.

If you have sources to suggest, add <!-- {source} --> after the paragraph.
