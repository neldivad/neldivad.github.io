Yet, most of us don't recognize how much conformism we do on a regularly basis.  It makes a lot of sense to follow the crowd. In data science, there is a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that is used very often and efficient to compute, especially if the application needs to make the prediction fast.  An example of a KNN is to associate a Japanese user with the average Japanese user. The software doesn't try to do fancy computation to model the user at high fidelity.  In financial markets, there is a trend following strategy, or ARIMA models, where the prediction of prices is based on past few day's prices. It's more &quot;braindead&quot; relative to exhaustively analyzing earnings report, growth rates, transcripts to predict prices and to generate a new valuation every time data changes.  Conformism brings order and stability, allowing societies to function smoothly. It facilitates the scaling of power and resources, which can enhance the collective evolutionary fitness of a group.  &quot;Trust the process&quot; works well in the sense that the group can save on computing and decision cost. The catch is that the process must keep working.  So a group of conformist who happened to be lucky enough to follow a right set of values will grow fast enough to destroy the population of a group of deviants who are either busy doing their own thing, or busy disagreeing among themselves.  However, if the conformist values misalign, mistakes cascades and wrong social directions are hard to stop -- the Pied Piper of Hamlin will lead all rats to drown in the river.  Conformism can also be exploited a subset of manipulative deviants, as values get hijacked to benefit a small cabal of deviants (cult leaders and equivalents).

While we see glorious success from a selected few independent thinkers and frequently talk about them, it is often the case we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.  Many artists, intellectuals, and other independent thinkers struggle financially and in terms of reproductive success. 1. This raises questions about the evolutionary viability of independent thinking and deviance.  In fact, we could use the market perspective to understand the quantitative tradeoffs and ROI between conformism and independent thinking.  In most advanced economies, the number of salaried workers (conformists) is much higher than the number of entrepreneurs (deviants).  Interestingly, the average earnings of salaried workers is higher than the average earnings of entrepreneurs -- an evidence of the survival advantage of conformism. 2  In ancient China, independent barbarians get defeated or absorbed by the more conforming empire.

By observing how AI agents respond to different reward functions, we can gain a better understanding of when and why humans might lean towards conformism or independent thinking.  So far, the most interesting AI agents used to simulate human cooperation is the Axelrod project.  The discovery is that the greatest survivors are agents who employ &quot;Tit-for-tat&quot; strategies in iterative Prisoner's Dilemma games.  Perhaps, a similar agent simulation could be used to discover the natural bias of agents towards conformism or defiance when status conscious becomes a parameter.      Footnotes​ Sigh, I knew you would take it the wrong way. I don't mean these people get less sex. Reproduction success in this context is more like the ability to replicate more independent thinkers. So a conformist builds social momentum faster than a deviant. So conformism grows like locusts, while deviance grows like a sequoia. ↩ That doesn't mean you should be a salaried worker for life.

Or, it's a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  The problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn't clear if the rich was actually the problem.  In the French Revolution, it's not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It's more like the top 1% against the top 0.1%. Most of the common people don't even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  Put simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it's in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.

The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is deliberate or accidental.  Many things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  Example, the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford tertiary education to gain the cultural capital required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  If you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees / license to bypass these regulations are the root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind. Yet, you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  In fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  On a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China's Gaokao -- The same system that is the most unfair and repressive to lower class also happened to get the most support and defense from the lower class.  Gaokao creates &quot;unequal&quot; outcomes and &quot;widening social class,&quot; in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people &quot;accidentally&quot; creating social division.  In effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the a category I would classify as &quot;opportunity stealing hero&quot; (OSH).  If you are convinced that China's gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you'll also find that most state's public education don't do better.  In US, public schools spend $20k per student for the results of 20% illiteracy rate. Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  If the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  Yet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSH.  With 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  Must have a way to avoid competition, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.Decisions are undemocratic (regulations setup by &quot;think tanks&quot; and &quot;experts&quot;)Victims having &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; to net negative practices.

In a competitive market, an unaccountable bank would face consequences for poor policies. In central bank's case, mostly its just &quot;bad luck&quot;, &quot;bad timing&quot;, &quot;oops&quot;.

Right now I'll just focus on the normal recruiting industry we all know and love.)  Anticompetitive​  Have you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?  A great recruiter should be paid by the quality of candidates they hire. In practice, recruiters get paid by the number of candidates they closed.  This means there is no pressure to properly vet for candidates for employers, or no pressure to help job seekers land jobs. You pay your LinkedIn Premium and they play you for a fool.  In more competitive markets, there is a &quot;money back guarantee&quot; for people who are unsatisfied with the product. A simple way to make HR competitive is to also have a &quot;money back guarantee&quot; system, where the recruiter forfeits their commission if the candidate is bad, or if the candidate couldn't find a job.  Why don't we do it?  Undemocratic​  HR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  For example, HR policies routinely use expensive educational degrees as prerequisites for roles -- even when the actual performance gap between degree holders and non-degree holders is negligible in many real-world contexts.  In effect, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn't problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.  To find out if degrees, licenses, or other credentials are actually a competency signal, a scientific method would be to look at the data by systematically measuring the quality of both recruits and rejects using an objective function.  I have hardly met any HR that does this 2.  It doesn't help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world.  Degrees now function more like a &quot;ticket you buy for the chance to work&quot; that gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.  HR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects. I've suggested a simple way to do it.  Yet, there is simply no market, competitive, moral pressure to do so.  Victims with Stockholm​  Business owners, shareholders, and job seekers think we are better off with them.  What people don't ask is how many of the problems the HR / recruitment industry solves are problems created by a bureacracy (that recruiters themselves are part of).  Example: employment rights, unions, protection of workers supposedly protect workers from unfair labor practices (Stockholm warning). But this also make it much harder for business owners to hire and fire employees, thus justifying the need for HR / recruiters.  The 2nd order effect is that business are less willing to hire and invest in employees, given that underperforming employees are so hard to let go.  I can't make the call that we are better off without labor regulations. But its important to understand the more complex we make labor laws, the more power HR and recruiters get.

What I notice is that problems that are so complicated to need a middleman tends to attract &quot;careerist&quot;3 to setup uncompetitive bureaucracy (IE: rent-seeking toll).  &quot;But aren't the rich the real final boss?&quot;  It's too convenient, too big of the brush, and often results in bad policies.

Footnotes​ Interestingly, federal income taxes we paid for granted started when the CB was invented at 1913. ↩ I've spoke around recruiters during informal settings. In most of my conversations with recruiters, the best indicator of a good candidate is &quot;what other recruiters&quot; say about them. In logical settings, this is known as &quot;circular reasoning&quot;. It's as unscientific as &quot;just vibes&quot;.

The question is should the public sponsor such careers? ↩ Parasite is a strong word, but the classification is that it must grow infinitely at the expense of the host's strength. This is consistent with my observations. The Fed gets stronger everytime they print more money and do not hesitate to increase their personnel. Similarly, HR went from 0.5% workforce to 1.5% workforce from 1980 to 2020. In the same time with the growth of these institutions, their &quot;customers&quot; get weaker.

Annually, the US government raises 17% of GDP as taxes.  In effect, we are spending $15 for every $100 we harass a productive business to give the state.  This number includes taxes paid through active means (IRS audits) and passive means (taxes on income, VAT). If we are to estimate the cost of active collection and the actual tax revenue active collectors raised, it may be less than the cost it takes to finance active collectors.

You don't win from someone's losses by lowballing. You also lose out on real information that would have stopped you from pursuing bad ideas.    Footnotes​ In rare cases, I met leaders who are great investors and they are great people to work with as they understand macro, accounting, and good business models. I hold suspicion to leaders who are responsible for a large part of the company and its workers future, but somehow find time for short-term derivatives and engage with trading systems they cannot explain. ↩ ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Less is more","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/less-is-more","content":"In any given business, the ideal state is that you can get away doing the least while creating the most outcome. In practice, idling looks like wasted cost, lost revenue. This philosophy is the result of us getting conditioned by centuries of economic model where labor time can be valued economically. It is hard escaping being a victim to this hustling mentality, where simply believing that if one can put in more hours one would be achieving more -- this view get more wrong with every progress made to automation and technology. When I'm composing music, in any given moment not all instruments are busy playing their own notes, yet somehow they are still able to create an &quot;effective symphony&quot; with so little activity from each individual. In fact, to achieve an effective symphony, it is necessary for pauses, emphasis, and passing spotlights to different parts and performers of the orchestra. The best composers or conductors don't make everyone play all the time. When I was an amateur, I thought the requirement to be a good composer is complexity, difficulty, and novelty, yet I notice a lot of great composers can get away with composition that is simple to play (C-major), cliched progressions (4/4 time signature) (1-4-5-6 progression) and still hitting the top charts. Inversely, a composition that is played by all parts of the orchestra constantly with complex maneuver are actually works done by an amateur. With the advent of digital music, it is now possible for composers to write in range and complexity that are impossible to perform. If difficulty and activity are signs of skill, then music topping the charts would have been electronic music with 10 instruments playing throughout the song at 200 BPM, with SFX automation clips stacked over one another. Clearly, the playlists we choose don't look like this. Given the lack of correlation (that is continuing to decrease) between activity and outcome, somehow businesses and people who want to improve their personal career are still stuck with the mindset that &quot;activity &gt;&gt; outcome&quot;. Somehow, it is unacceptable for any employee to not have a backlog full of events. It is shameful to be seen by your friends that you don't have a full schedule one month ahead of you. You look like a loser if you don't have anything going on during your weekends or holidays. Ask any artist, software developer, writer that is competent, and they always seem to arrive to the same answer-- effective emptiness, blanks, and space is required in a finished good product. I think management and hustlers have a lot to learn from these people.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"We can't afford job security","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/we-cant-afford-job-security","content":"If you understand government budgets, you will stop believing in job security. There is no such thing as job security -- especially not in a role without craftsmanship -- without taking away freedom from future generations. Why? Because most people's idea of &quot;job security&quot; requires them to be a high paying white-collar bureaucrat in an office with a big corner desk. Who wants to have a secure job that needs you to deal with dirt, danger, difficulties? If you can handle those 3Ds I guarantee your career is secure 100%. Incidentally, those are the jobs people look forward the most to be replaced. Therefore, the reality is not that there is &quot;no job security&quot;, rather it is &quot;there is not enough non-3D secure jobs&quot; in this world, because each one requires a government or bureaucracy to print or devalue existing currency to keep you and your desk. When everyone thinks they are entitled to that illusion, what do you think is going to happen to future generations? Some people worked hard to get a cushy, secure job as a C-level in some corporate, public office, conglomerate, consultancy, education institution. An average person will think the price is decades of hard work climbing the career ladder and dealing with occasional office politics -- it is not the only price paid. If the job is an administrative role where the &quot;ascension&quot; requires building a wall to keep off competitors (EG: adding regulations, raising licensing requirements to limit labor supply), paper pushing (office equivalent of digging a hole then filling a hole), it may be complicit in making some of the younger generations less free in doing productive work and less free with their social mobility. If you ever felt &quot;credential inflation&quot; and lower conversion rates in job application rates, this is what's happening and you have the market that existed before you to thank. If you are still young and starting out in your career, stop buying the idea or complaining about job security -- it was never there. If it was, then the (money printing and deficit spending) ship has sailed and you need to start making something for yourself. Look up your state's public spending, learn how to read financial statements of companies, and learn how money and value is created. You will quickly come to conclusion the only way wealth can be created is to do something that helps people and do it better (IE: getting better at your craft). Most office jobs today are &quot;state manufactured elites&quot;. IE: the state lends money for someone to get into college, get in debt, then offers them to be a slave for the state. It is as ridiculous as minting your own crypto, selling &quot;scholarships&quot; to players by borrowing them your axoloties, and sending those axolotl to battle as a chore. 1 The difference is one does it with fictional currency. The other does it with printed or taxed money. If you think its unsustainable, we are very close to the end of line. If you want real job security, you must accept 3Ds, or be so good at your craft that no one beats you at your game.

Opposing the establishment, especially in fields like politics is a braindead strategy to gain attention and support.  For example, political candidates may rise to power simply by positioning themselves as opponents of the existing order, without necessarily offering substantial or innovative policies.  The case of Tachibana Takeshi is a great illustration. His political ascent was primarily fueled by his opposition to the NHK fee -- a stance that resonated with many who were dissatisfied with the status quo. However, once in power, it became evident that his strategy, politics, and philosophy lacked depth and he lost his momentum after &quot;the dragon has been slain&quot;.  The point is &quot;braindead opposition strategy&quot; against any target that sticks out is very rewarding, and deviants unintentionally create opportunities for others to gain prominence by simply opposing them.

It is much simpler and less risky for individuals to conform to the majority opinion than to challenge it.  When deviants change people's minds, they encounter resistance because their message forces others to confront their own vulnerabilities or mistakes.  This can lead to defensive reactions, as individuals feel compelled to double down on their established positions to avoid appearing wrong.  This dynamic is even more obvious in institutional settings, where admitting the validity of an deviant's ideas means rejecting the institution they are part of -- it is an equivalent of being placed in an &quot;ideological death ground&quot; if one has a career or is dependent on the survival of the institution.  In cases of a person being placed in &quot;death grounds&quot;, the pushback is desperate, regardless of how right a deviant's ideas are.

Footnotes​ if you can't see what I did there, I'm disappointed. ↩ There are cases of autistic people who can do own thing competently and oblivious to the negativity or oppositions of others. While such ignorance means they are not held back by public opinion, it is still more probable their avant-garde work meets more resistance relative to support. ↩ Inversely, it could mean any person who experienced a chronic disagreements are more likely to see themselves as a deviant -- this is fallacy thinking. Someone who is consistently disagreed may see themselves as a deviant, but that doesn't mean they are not a conformist. A conformist can keep saying the wrong thing, be disagreed by a diverse group of people, and they will wrongly imagine that they are a deviant and the rest are conformist. ↩ ↩2 In cases of a group of people who don't compare with one another, you notice that independent behaviors don't meet as much rejections as these groups have no status games to play with one another. Since neither cares much about their own reputation, another person's action doesn't bring them any threat and you observe less &quot;witch-hunting&quot; behavior. ↩ A simple observation is to observe artists and their behavior pre-fame and post-fame. An artist is an embodiment of independence. But anyone who observes an artist that rises to fame is that they become less controversial the more popular they are. If my theory is true, artists who gets less controversial become like that because they have more interest in developing status consciousness. ↩ I expect pushback for saying this, but I think this reason also explains why creative women are less common than creative men. Women are more status conscious, so there is a disadvantage in the capacity to hold independent thoughts. That is not to say women are less creative -- a woman who is detached from status conscious are just as capable of being creative. Inversely, a man that is burdened by status-conscious will have as much trouble being creative. ↩ This theory also support the observation that many great art in ancient history was done by non-hetero people (Michelangelo, Nikola Tesla). But as LGBTQ and DEI gathers more social momentum and subsequently more conformist, you see a decline in the quality of art produced by non-hetero people if they happen to be absorbed by the conformist movement (Snow White and Concord are the latest disasters). ↩ ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Test MDX","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/blog/test-mdx","content":"// Render a YouTube video player","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"About","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"How do I use this documentation?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"About","url":"/docs/intro#how-do-i-use-this-documentation","content":" Just a site I use to log all of my progress and projects.
