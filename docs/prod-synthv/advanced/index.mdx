# Advanced

Synth V advanced will contain guides on setting up scripting, as well as certain custom scripts I've built and study how I use them in my production. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

My implementation may not work for you. You should still visit the [official docs](https://svdocs.dreamtonics.com/en/synthv/advanced-usage/scripts) for more information on scripting.
