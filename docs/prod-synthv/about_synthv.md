Synthesizer V is a software developed by Dreamtonics. Dreamtonics is a Tokyo-based startup specializing in electronic music and voice technology. 

If you are familair with vocaloids and Hatsune Miku, SynthV essentially does the same thing. 

## Why not Miku? 
Sound preference, pricing, and workflow. I choose SynthV because it fits the workflow I want to use and it is as simple as that. I also find older generation's vocaloids to be too robotic in sound. 

For some producers, those are the sounds they want to go for. There is also an element of producer attachment to voicebanks that have been anthromorphisized (IE: having an anime face as a wrapper) that had attracted a community and fans.

If those are important to you, SynthV may not be for you.  

## Key Features of Synthesizer V

- **Voice Banks**: Access to a wide range of high-quality voice banks for diverse vocal sounds. You get a free voice bank "Mai" who sound really good out of the box and is better than most other paid voicebanks depending on what you make her do. 
- **MIDI Import**: Easily import MIDI files to create vocal melodies and harmonies.
- **Phoneme Editing**: Fine-tune vocal performances by adjusting individual phonemes.
- **Export Options**: Render high-quality vocal tracks for use in your projects.

I will spare you the details of the product. Just go to their [official store](https://www.dreamtonics.com/synthesizerv/) and see if its right for you.

## FAQ
### "Voice banks are so expensive!"
I believe the company uses the "razer blade" model, where the software is underpriced while the majority of the accessories and plugins are where they get their margins. 

### "Can I switch voice banks?" 
Yes, you can. Note that many voice banks do not work well by directly using the same MIDI and have **voice-unique-automations** [^1]. 

[^1]: Refers to automation parameters that are unique to the voice bank itself. Example: `Mai: [Emotional, Soft]`; `Eri: [Aggressive, Focused, Relaxed, Singing]`

Especially for raps, often the pitch is not even melodic [^2] and very dependent on the producer interpretation.

[^2]: Meaning, the pitch used to express the rap very often doesn't follow the melody or the key of the song. This is more common when attempting Chinese raps. (Chinese has [4 tones](https://www.howtosayinchinese.com/learn-chinese-tones-mandarin-accent/) used to express any given pinyin, which results in very interesting pitch and wave designs when working on a rap project)

If you take someone else's SVP (synth v project) file that uses a different voice and try to make it work with your own voice, it will likely not work well. 

You should be sharing untuned voiced files in SVP and tune your final voice from scratch. Its tedious but that's how it is.
