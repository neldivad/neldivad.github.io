# About

### How do I use this documentation?

Just a site I use to log all of my progress and projects. Notably, the techniques I use to create my work. 

The documentation is divided into sections and workflows, particularly in music production.

Example directory: 
```

|-- Mastering

|-- Synthesizer V
    |-- How I use Synthesizer V to create vocals.
