Mixing is the process of taking recorded tracks and blending them together to create a cohesive and polished audio recording. A good mix strikes a balance between levels, tones, and spatial placement, ensuring that all elements of the song are heard clearly and contribute to the overall emotional impact.

This guide will walk you through the basics of mixing, advanced techniques, and practical examples of using FL Studio's stock plugins for professional-sounding mixes.

## Key Concepts

- **Level Balancing**: Ensuring no single track overshadows others.
- **Frequency Balancing**: Adjusting EQ to create space for all instruments and voices.
- **Depth and Width**: Using reverb, delay, and stereo imaging to create a 3D soundstage.
- **Dynamics Control**: Using compression and limiting to control the loudness and consistency of the mix.
