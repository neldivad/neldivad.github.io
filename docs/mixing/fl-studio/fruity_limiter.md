(ai-generated edit after time)



### What It Does
The Fruity Limiter is a brickwall limiter designed to prevent your mix from exceeding a certain level, ensuring itâ€™s loud and clear without distorting.

### How to Use It

1. **Threshold**: Set to your desired maximum level (e.g., -3dB).
2. **Release**: Adjust based on the material (shorter for transient-heavy tracks).
3. **Gain**: Compensate for lost volume after limiting.
4. **Metering**: Use the built-in meter to monitor peak levels.

### Example Uses
- Master bus: Prevent peaks and maximize loudness.
- Drum bus: Control dynamics and glue the drums together.
