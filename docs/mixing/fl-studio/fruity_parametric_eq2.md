   - Use the frequency knob to find the specific frequency you want to adjust.
   - Use the spectrum analyzer to visually identify imbalances.

2. **Gain Adjustment**:
   - Boost to add presence or cut to remove unwanted frequencies.
   - Make small, incremental adjustments (e.g., ±3dB).

3. **Bandwidth (Q) Adjustment**:
   - Narrow bandwidth for precise adjustments.
   - Wide bandwidth for broader tone shaping.

4. **A/B Comparison**:
