Before diving into advanced techniques, itâ€™s essential to grasp the fundamental principles of mixing. This page provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with mixing.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Session

- Import all recorded tracks into your DAW.
- Organize tracks into groups (e.g., drums, vocals, guitars, synths).
- Set up a stereo out bus and make sure all tracks are routed to it.

## Step 2: Balancing Levels

1. Start with the loudest track (e.g., kick drum) and set its fader to around -12dB to -6dB.
2. Add each track one by one, adjusting faders to ensure they sit well in the mix.
3. Use the mute and solo buttons to isolate and compare levels.

## Step 3: EQ Basics

- **Cut Before Boosting**: Remove unwanted frequencies before adding tone.
- **Low Cut (High Pass Filter)**: Remove rumble and mud from tracks.
- **High Cut (Low Pass Filter)**: Remove harsh highs from instruments.
- **Mid Frequencies**: Add presence to vocals or clarity to instruments.

## Step 4: Compression Essentials

- **Threshold**: Set so the compressor starts reducing levels when the signal reaches this point.
- **Ratio**: Determines how much the compressor reduces the signal.
- **Attack and Release**: Adjust to match the dynamics of the track.
- **Makeup Gain**: Compensate for lost volume after compression.

## Step 5: Panning and Imaging

- Use the pan knob to place instruments in the stereo field.
- Create space by panning similar instruments to opposite sides.
- Use mono and stereo imaging tools to check phase and compatibility.

## Step 6: Grouping and Bussing

- Group similar tracks into sub-groups (e.g., drums, vocals).
- Apply EQ and compression to the entire group for consistency.
- Automate group levels to make adjustments over time.

## Step 7: Reference Tracks

- Import a reference track into your session for comparison.
- A/B your mix against the reference to identify areas for improvement.

## Step 8: Listening and Revisions

- Listen to your mix on different speakers and headphones.
- Take notes on what needs adjustment.
- Make small, incremental changes and revisit the mix with fresh ears.

By mastering these basics, you'll have a solid foundation for creating balanced and professional-sounding mixes.
