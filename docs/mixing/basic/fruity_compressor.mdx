If you want my TLDR on how to use it, typically there is only 4 knobs that matters in THAT ORDER: 
1. Threshold
2. Ratio
3. Gain
4. Type

## Usage:
### Raising the volume of a signal 
Just turn the `Gain` knob up down. 

### Balancing the volume of a signal 
Turn the `Threshold` knob down until everything is quiet. 

Optional:
1. Turn the `Ratio` knob up to after `Threshold` to increase the volume of the quiet parts. 
2. Change the `Type` between `Soft`, `Medium`, `Hard`, to make the compression more gentle. A hard compression will kill off peaking signals very quickly, which may make transients (aka the "punch" of the drums") weaker (aka not as sharp to the ears). A soft compression will make transients keep their "punchiness" but may result in signals that exceed limit, which could distort analog devices. 
3. `Attack` and `Release` are the time it takes for the compression to kick in and out of the signal. Usually you only touch this after the 4 knobs. 

Finally, turn the `Gain` knob up until everything is as loud as before. This is how you raise quiet parts without also increasing the volume of loud parts.
