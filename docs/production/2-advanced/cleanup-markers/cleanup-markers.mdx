title: Cleanup Markers (Script)
---

## Problem
I have an annoying problem with FL studio when trying to do arrangement with my method. 

In FL Studio, the piano roll typically guards against stacked time markers.

However, if you use the `CTRL + G` method to merge patterns from the playlist window, the piano roll will not guard against stacked markers.

## Pyscript solution
The following script will remove all stacked markers. Importantly, it will preserve the time signature markers!

```python

import flpianoroll as flp

dialog = """
by NEL-V
version: 0.1

Removes all stacked time signature markers from piano roll, typically caused by Alt + G on patterns. 
"""

def createDialog():
    # Find stacked time signature markers (markers at the same time position)
    time_sig_markers_by_time = {}
    
    for m in range(flp.score.markerCount):
        marker = flp.score.getMarker(m)
        
        # Check if this is a time signature marker (has tsnum and tsden properties)
        if hasattr(marker, 'tsnum') and hasattr(marker, 'tsden'):
            time = marker.time
