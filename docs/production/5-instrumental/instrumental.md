Creating melodies and harmonies will give your track its unique identity. Here’s how to get started.

## Step 1: Choosing a Sound

- Select a synth or sample that fits your track’s mood.
- Experiment with different presets or create your own.

## Step 2: Programming Melodies

- Start with a simple melody that follows your track’s chord progression.
- Use arpeggios or sequences for rhythmic interest.

## Step 3: Adding Harmonies

- Double your main melody with a second layer.
- Add subtle variations for depth.

## Step 4: Basic Instrument Processing

- Use EQ to carve out space in the mix.
- Apply reverb and delay for depth.
- Use compression to control dynamics.
