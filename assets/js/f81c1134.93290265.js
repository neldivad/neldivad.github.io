These individuals are often showcased as beacons of innovation and progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, despite this glorification, conformism remains is the norm, not exception through all observed history. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## The paradox\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any given moment, the majority tends to follow established norms, whether they are being conservative or simply unable to form independent thoughts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we value independence and innovation so highly, why do conformists continue to outnumber independent thinkers? \\r\\n\\r\\nIs there an inherent advantage to conformism that ensures its prevalence, or are we merely paying lip service to the idea of valuing independence?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Evolutionary perspectives on conformism and defiance\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, traits that confer a survival advantage are more likely to persist and propagate. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf independent thinking provided a clear evolutionary edge, you should expect independent thinkers to gradually outpace conformists. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, historical observation contradicts this expectation. Conformists have consistently outnumbered independent thinkers across different eras. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis begs the question: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Does independent thinking hold an evolutionary disadvantage? \\r\\n\\r\\n- Does conformism offer unseen benefits that contribute to group survival and cohesion?\\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## Deep diving conformism\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is easy to have low opinions about conformism, or towards conformists. Yet, most of us don\'t recognize how much conformism we do on a regularly basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt makes a lot of sense to follow the crowd. In data science, there is a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that is used very often and efficient to compute, especially if the application needs to make the prediction fast. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of a KNN is to associate a Japanese user with the average Japanese user. The software doesn\'t try to do fancy computation to model the user at high fidelity. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn financial markets, there is a trend following strategy, or ARIMA models, where the prediction of prices is based on past few day\'s prices. It\'s more \\"braindead\\" relative to exhaustively analyzing earnings report, growth rates, transcripts to predict prices and to generate a new valuation every time data changes. \\r\\n\\r\\nConformism brings order and stability, allowing societies to function smoothly. It facilitates the scaling of power and resources, which can enhance the collective evolutionary fitness of a group. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Trust the process\\" works well in the sense that the group can save on computing and decision cost. The catch is that the process must keep working. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo a group of conformist who happened to be lucky enough to follow a right set of values will grow fast enough to destroy the population of a group of deviants who are either busy doing their own thing, or busy disagreeing among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if the conformist values misalign, mistakes cascades and wrong social directions are hard to stop -- the Pied Piper of Hamlin will lead all rats to drown in the river. \\r\\n\\r\\nConformism can also be exploited a subset of manipulative deviants, as values get hijacked to benefit a small cabal of deviants (cult leaders and equivalents).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Evolutionary disadvantage of deviants\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent thinkers, while often celebrated, [frequently face challenges that conformists do not.](/blog/2025/01-23-why-independent-people-invite-troubles.mdx) \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we see glorious success from a selected few independent thinkers and frequently talk about them, it is often the case we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany artists, intellectuals, and other independent thinkers struggle financially and in terms of reproductive success. [^1]. This raises questions about the evolutionary viability of independent thinking and deviance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Sigh, I knew you would take it the wrong way. I don\'t mean these people get less sex. Reproduction success in this context is more like the ability to replicate more independent thinkers. So a conformist builds social momentum faster than a deviant. So conformism grows like locusts, while deviance grows like a sequoia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, we could use the market perspective to understand the quantitative tradeoffs and ROI between conformism and independent thinking. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn most advanced economies, the number of salaried workers (conformists) is much higher than the number of entrepreneurs (deviants).\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, the average earnings of salaried workers is higher than the average earnings of entrepreneurs -- an evidence of the survival advantage of conformism. [^2]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: That doesn\'t mean you should be a salaried worker for life. I\'ve done a deep macro research explaining how job security is a [debt-financed illusion](/blog/2025/01-05-we-cant-afford-job-security.md). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn ancient China, independent barbarians get defeated or absorbed by the more conforming empire. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## AI simulations on conformism and defiance\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market perspective used to understand the quantitative tradeoffs between conformism and independent thinking is one way to do it, but we could also use AI simulations to explore the interplay between environmental factors, incentive structures, and behavioral outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy observing how AI agents respond to different reward functions, we can gain a better understanding of when and why humans might lean towards conformism or independent thinking. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, the most interesting AI agents used to simulate human cooperation is the [Axelrod project](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery is that the greatest survivors are agents who employ \\"Tit-for-tat\\" strategies in iterative Prisoner\'s Dilemma games. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, a similar agent simulation could be used to discover the natural bias of agents towards conformism or defiance when status conscious becomes a parameter. \\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"how-to-steal-from-the-public","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-public","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025/02-19-how-to-steal-from-the-young/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025/02-19-how-to-steal-from-the-young/index.md","title":"How to steal from the public without public attention","description":"Today\'s generation is prosperous.

But it\'s also plagued by problems similar to the past.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing wealth gaps, squeezed middle class, low birth rates, public debts that are increasing unsustainable, difficult job market.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainstream narrative now is that the rich have been exploiting the poor, and that all of the problems will go away if only we tax them enough or regulate their profits such that it is no longer predatory. Or, it\'s a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn\'t clear if the rich was actually the problem.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the French Revolution, it\'s not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It\'s more like the [top 1% against the top 0.1%](https://x.com/GaletteSaw6/status/1892255392987582924/photo/1). Most of the common people don\'t even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPut simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it\'s in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHow then should one find the dishonest actor that explains all of the present problems and injustice without resorting to sloppy reasoning that matches what the mainstream wants you to antagonize?   \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Discovering the anatomy of the heist  \\r\\n\\r\\nMost understand that problems and inefficiency don\'t come out of nowhere, therefore something/someone must be responsible. The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is **deliberate** or **accidental**.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMany things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  \\r\\n\\r\\nExample, the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford [tertiary education to gain the cultural capital](https://wcer.wisc.edu/docs/working-papers/Working_Paper_No_2017_2.pdf) required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees / license to bypass these regulations are the **root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind**. Yet, you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China\'s Gaokao -- The same system that is the [most unfair and repressive to lower class](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/22125868211035802?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.192) also happened to [get the most support and defense from the lower class](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/comment/k42ydza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  \\r\\n\\r\\nGaokao creates \\"unequal\\" outcomes and \\"widening social class,\\" in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people \\"accidentally\\" creating social division.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the a category I would classify as \\"opportunity stealing hero\\" (OSH).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are convinced that China\'s gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you\'ll also find that most state\'s public education don\'t do better.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[In US, public schools spend $20k per student](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics) for the results of [20% illiteracy rate](https://www.thenationalliteracyinstitute.com/post/literacy-statistics-2024-2025-where-we-are-now). Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSH.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  \\r\\n\\r\\n- **Must have a way to avoid competition**, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.  \\r\\n- **Decisions are undemocratic** (regulations setup by \\"think tanks\\" and \\"experts\\")  \\r\\n- [**Victims having \\"Stockholm syndrome\\"** to net negative practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/whats_the_deal_with_chinas_gao_kao/). (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enjoy where your logic will take you, stop scrolling and start thinking and see if your answers match with mine later.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will do the honors and take the risk of exposing institutions with questionable motive and outcomes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHere goes.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Shortlisted bureaucracies  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Central banks  \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Uncompetitive\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral banks serve as the lender of last resort -- a function that allows them to provide emergency liquidity to banks, thereby forestalling systemic collapse. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one else gets this right to create value out of nothing. While it\'s hard to say they are dishonest, there is no way we can know how accountable too. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a competitive market, an unaccountable bank would face consequences for poor policies. In central bank\'s case, mostly its just \\"bad luck\\", \\"bad timing\\", \\"oops\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nFor CB with weaker political power, it is possible for market players to force a competitive decision. (EG: [George Soros breaking the BoE by betting against their bad policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/altvbm/the_man_who_broke_the_bank_of_england/))\\r\\n\\r\\nFor stronger CB, especially the US Federal Reserve,\\r\\n[it took decades for people to realize and agree some disastrous results done by central banks.](https://www.econlib.org/yes-monetary-policy-did-cause-the-great-depression/) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Undemocratic  \\r\\n\\r\\n[The public cannot elect a Fed Chair; the selection process is conducted behind closed doors with little transparency](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12591.htm) -- comparable in its secrecy to the election of a pope. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fed Chair can make policies that influence credit markets such that it directly kills business or raise portfolio value.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n[The 2% inflation target is a dogma, not an expert research or public agreement.](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2023/09/04/why-the-2-inflation-target/) I can read the whole link to you. Or I can just tell you it\'s all vibes. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Enough victims with Stockholm.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMany are \u201cvictimized\u201d by policies done by CB. If you own cash, the real value of their money is eroded by inflation. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, most can\'t reject this poison, especially if you are an office workers with state contracts (where do you think the state gets their money to pay your contract work?), is a homeowners whose asset values grow together with each successive rounds of money printing. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you work in office, your employment is likely an illusion. They will still raise back enough taxes from you to make back the money they printed to pay you [^1]. If you have any more left to spend, they will devalue it by printing the next round of money.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Interestingly, [federal income taxes we paid for granted started when the CB was invented at 1913](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/history-taxes.asp).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe become unwitting \u201cStockholmers\u201d by growing psychologically dependent on a system that also steals from us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Human resources and recruiting industry  \\r\\n\\r\\n(*There is a whole rabbit hole known as \\"executive recruiting\\" that is not covered in this article. Right now I\'ll just focus on the normal recruiting industry we all know and love.*)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Anticompetitive\\r\\n> Have you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?  \\r\\n\\r\\nA great recruiter should be paid by the quality of candidates they hire. In practice, recruiters get paid by the number of candidates they closed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis means there is no pressure to properly vet for candidates for employers, or no pressure to help job seekers land jobs. You pay your LinkedIn Premium and they play you for a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more competitive markets, there is a \\"money back guarantee\\" for people who are unsatisfied with the product.  A simple way to make HR competitive is to also have a \\"money back guarantee\\" system, where the recruiter forfeits their commission if the candidate is bad, or if the candidate couldn\'t find a job. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy don\'t we do it?\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Undemocratic\\r\\nHR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, HR policies routinely use expensive educational degrees as prerequisites for roles -- even when the actual performance gap between degree holders and non-degree holders is negligible in many real-world contexts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn\'t problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find out if degrees, licenses, or other credentials are actually a competency signal, a scientific method would be to look at the data by systematically measuring the quality of both recruits and rejects using an objective function.\\r\\n\\r\\n**I have hardly met any HR that does this** [^2].\\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: I\'ve spoke around recruiters during informal settings. In most of my conversations with recruiters, the best indicator of a good candidate is \\"what other recruiters\\" say about them. In logical settings, this is known as \\"circular reasoning\\". It\'s as unscientific as \\"just vibes\\". Yeah, you think people who make important decisions are more responsibile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\'t help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world. \\r\\n\\r\\nDegrees now function more like a \\"ticket you buy for the chance to work\\" that [gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.](https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/pierre-bourdieu-cultural-capital-in-the-21st-century/)  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects. [I\'ve suggested a simple way to do it.](/blog/2025/01-03-how-to-test-recruiting.md)\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, there is simply no market, competitive, moral pressure to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Victims with Stockholm\\r\\nBusiness owners, shareholders, and job seekers think we are better off with them. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat people don\'t ask is how many of the problems the HR / recruitment industry solves are problems created by a bureacracy (that recruiters themselves are part of). \\r\\n\\r\\nExample: employment rights, unions, protection of workers supposedly protect workers from unfair labor practices (Stockholm warning). But this also make it much harder for business owners to hire and fire employees, thus justifying the need for HR / recruiters. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2nd order effect is that business are less willing to hire and invest in employees, given that underperforming employees are so hard to let go. \\r\\n\\r\\nI can\'t make the call that we are better off without labor regulations. But its important to understand the more complex we make labor laws, the more power HR and recruiters get. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, job seekers lose and business owners lose. \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n## FAQ\\r\\n> \\"Is it a \\"middleman problem\\"? \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe most of the bad things in life are not intentional. It\'s very rare to meet someone with a mission to cause as much damage as they can while getting away with it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis means its important to inspect for systems that are supposedly \\"good\\" but at some point stop serving the interest of the system consumer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I notice is that problems that are so complicated to need a middleman tends to attract \\"careerist\\"[^3] to setup uncompetitive bureaucracy (IE: rent-seeking toll).\\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: Career usually mean something better than job and supposedly requires more respect. But rent-seeking can also be a career. The question is should the public sponsor such careers? \\r\\n\\r\\n> \\"But aren\'t the rich the real final boss?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s too convenient, too big of the brush, and often results in bad policies. Instead, I think it\'s more helpful to expose people to the anatomy of how institutions can take advantage of the public. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as the public are uncritical about their practices, the bureacracy can keep masquerading as a value-creator when its a parasite [^4]. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^4]: Parasite is a strong word, but the classification is that it must grow infinitely at the expense of the host\'s strength. This is consistent with my observations. The Fed gets stronger everytime they print more money and do not hesitate to increase their personnel. Similarly, HR went from 0.5% workforce to 1.5% workforce from 1980 to 2020. In the same time with the growth of these institutions, their \\"customers\\" get weaker. This is unlike competitive economic systems (example Nvidia) where their growth is also followed by the growth in strength by their customers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"real-function-of-taxes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/real-function-of-taxes","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025/02-10-real-function-of-taxes.md","source":"@site/blog/2025/02-10-real-function-of-taxes.md","title":"The real function of taxes","description":"Taxes are dumb.","date":"2025-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"economics","permalink":"/blog/tags/economics"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"}],"readingTime":8.57,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"real-function-of-taxes","title":"The real function of taxes","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["economics","finance"]},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740292114000,"prevItem":{"title":"How to steal from the public without public attention","permalink":"/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-public"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why independent people invite troubles","permalink":"/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles"}},"content":"Taxes are dumb. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s hard to be controversial to say so. Most people who worked and earned money for a living would be frustrated by the whole experience that is so embedded in modern society, to the point it becomes something we learned to be helpless about. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis post won\'t try to change the way taxes work. I\'m too small of a player for the legal system to give a damn about. [^1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: if you can\'t see what I did there, I\'m disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, I can explain how taxes work in a way that the common person will learn, and people can decide if taxes are worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Modern monetary theory\\r\\n\\r\\nModern money is all fiat, meaning it is not backed by anything. Not gold, not oil, just blind trust. Actually, it is backed by the power of military[^2], but we will leave the story to another day. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: Modern fiat currencies aren\'t entirely worthless. Typically currency is legitimized through public confidence. A currency that can be printed endlessly would mean more people opting out of the network. But confidence is fragile and fluctuates, so a mandate and force is more reliable. You will notice that reserve currencies tend to be controlled by contries with the strongest military. It is no coincidence. Having a gun means you accept whatever value there is on the paper. This is also a short story why I think cryptocurrencies are unviable. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are to accept that money is not backed by anything, a state theoretically doesn\'t need to collect taxes before they spend -- they can just spend on what they want and pay it back later by raising taxes, or to do nothing and devalue all cash and savings. \\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"Why bother collecting taxes?\\"\\r\\nGreat question. The amount of effort it takes to collect taxes is enormous. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the US as an example (its the most available one to build my priors) [the estimates of tax compliance cost of the $546 billion, or nearly 2 percent of GDP.](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/irs-tax-compliance-costs/) \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnually, the US government raises [17% of GDP as taxes](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, we are spending $15 for every $100 we harass a productive business to give the state. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis number includes taxes paid through active means (IRS audits) and passive means (taxes on income, VAT). If we are to estimate the cost of active collection and the actual tax revenue active collectors raised, it may be less than the cost it takes to finance active collectors. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s like spending $100 on debt collectors (debt isn\'t even a right word as it implies we owe the state our production) to raise something less than $100. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the objective of taxes is really to raise capital to afford projects, active collection seems ineffective at what they do. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of answering why are we doing something inefficient, let\'s start with what happens if we just do nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 1: Really doing nothing\\r\\n\\r\\nNo government spending, no taxes, constant supply of money. The state is literally sleeping at the wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnrealistic scenario, but suppose this happens we should predict inflation to be 0%. This seems like a time when we have a perfect currency. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is that the economy becomes perfectly competitive, which means those that earn will hold more currency and control a bigger share of the network (mercantilism). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe currency becomes less representative to those who are weaker or less competitive. With no state spending, there is no safety net except for private charities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf people expect spending will cause them to lose power to sellers, then transactions are seen as zero-sum and the economy gets more illiquid. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, not having a state is really a bad idea, in the sense that markets become lawless. In practice what you\'ll end up getting is local mafias bullying businesses into giving them special privileges -- you don\'t pay taxes to the state, but you pay \\"taxes\\" to guys meaner than you. [^5]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^5]: The irony is that by electing a state to keep mafias away, a state can eventually grow big enough to be a \\"mafia\\" itself, in the sense they bully people into compliance through \\"legal\\" and \\"financial\\" means (by manipulating currencies). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 2: Doing anything the state wants\\r\\n\\r\\nState prints as much money as it wants, gives out as much to anyone who will vote for them. Never collects any of them back. \\r\\n\\r\\nSounds too good to be true. Now people stop producing because there is no reason to. When there is no production, all the money can\'t buy anything -- you have a hyperinflation situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s more! When people expect the currency to get weaker, the network of producers becomes more reluctant to accept the currency -- people rather do a barter trade or keep good things for themselves than to take your currency.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 3: Spend now, collect back everything later\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"perfect\\" scenario. The state spends as much as it wants to get something done, then get back all the money it spent back from people through taxes. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo net inflation, and stuff gets done! What\'s the problem? \\r\\n\\r\\n#### There is always a better deal \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a more perfect scenario -- stuff gets done, and people keep all the newly minted currency. If something valuable was already done, why waste energy to give back the catalyst (ie: the currency)?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem happens when the currency gets spent on more things than it was made to spend on (IE: buying labor for social services becomes salary to spend and compete on limited goods) -- Taxes ensures the velocity of created money is not infinite. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice people can always argue why they don\'t need to return the currency, so its hard to take back as much money as we created. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Whose stuff gets done? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe state can create money to buy for things they want, but in practice you can bet the decisions aren\'t fair (IE: what the state wants to buy might not be what the people want to buy).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the state can just set up a shell company with their entourage, print some money and pay his friends and declaring his friends are being \\"paid to do social work\\". -- This is wastage in a nutshell. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, things are not so blatant. Its more likely for state actors to set up lots of layers of agency that takes some cut of the budget, where the agency also happens to contain a share of the state\'s entourage -- also known as \\"deep state\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nSo a scenario with perfect balance sheet is not perfect if the work paid to do / things bought isn\'t representative. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Crowding out\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the state prints money to hire workers, then it means someone else would lose the worker they wanted to hire to do their work. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a free market, the most important work gets done first and that is reflected by prices and bids. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the state spends money, it is unclear if the work that needs to be done are the most important ones. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen suboptimal decisions are made and financed, in effect that is also a net loss to the people. It\'s like saying you win 10% doing something when you could have won 50% doing nothing -- a good outcome is not a valid defense for a good decision. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## It\'s all decisions\\r\\nNotice the theme here. The state can do anything it wants, but its decisions must be sound (IE: logical, benefits the people, within budget). \\r\\n\\r\\nA sound decision is one that is profitable. IE: You spend little to do a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the state does something suboptimal, the net effect is the people\'s standard of living will devalue because they: \\r\\n1. need to ask more taxes from the people to pay back what they spent.\\r\\n2. print more money to pay back what they spent, creating inflation. \\r\\n\\r\\n**In modern finance, taxes are paid so inflation does not happen.**\\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## \\"Why not just let inflation happen?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat question. If the net effect of ineffective state spending is lower standards of living, and the way it is delivered can be either passive (through inflation) or active (through taxes), we could choose to do nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy go through all the hassle and trouble to feel pain? \\r\\n\\r\\nI could write a whole post on how money works, how it flows. But the short answer I discovered after 20 years of studying money is: \\"it\'s all politics\\". \\r\\n\\r\\n> You will never understand bureaucracies until you understand that for bureaucrats procedure is everything and outcomes are nothing. -- Thomas Sowell\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the post is critical about taxes, there are some cases when it can make sense... [^3] [^4] \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, rather than trying so hard to raise taxes, there is a better way...\\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: Unlike inflation that erodes power indiscrimately, taxes are are more targeted to specific people. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^4]: There is a perspective where taxes make sense, like a \\"subscription\\" to the government. Some people uses more public services, like roads, hospital. So higher taxes are like your \\"silver, gold, platinum\\" subscription tiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \\"Stop spending (other people\'s) money on stupid stuff\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople think public spending is free money. I\'ve already shown you that public spending takes back money through taxes or inflation -- it is just financial physics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why people think public spending is free money -- that voters consistently vote for money spending across any civilization -- I suspect has to do with \\"semantic deception\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nIf people really understood how public spending gets paid back, perhaps they wouldn\'t be so obsessed with the idea of \\"free money\\". The issue is that the sematics \\"public spending\\" gives people the idea that it is \\"money spent on the public\\", so we just ignored all the little things that happen behind the scenes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same \\"semantic deception\\" can happen in things like \\"trust and safety team\\" [^6] , \\"conservative and liberal\\" [^7].\\r\\n\\r\\n[^6]: Many times whatever they do has nothing to do with trust or safety. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^7]: The word conservative artificially signals someone to be close-minded, liberal an open-minded. But you find that the signal isn\'t any reliable. People who get manipulated by semantic deception would prefer liberal to conservative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"why-independent-people-invite-troubles","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-independent-people-invite-troubles","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025/01-23-why-independent-people-invite-troubles.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025/01-23-why-independent-people-invite-troubles.mdx","title":"Why independent people invite troubles","description":"I am surrounded by independent thinkers.","date":"2025-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"essays","permalink":"/blog/tags/essays"}],"readingTime":6.255,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Why independent people invite troubles","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["essays"],"slug":"why-independent-people-invite-troubles"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740250128000,"prevItem":{"title":"The real function of taxes","permalink":"/blog/real-function-of-taxes"},"nextItem":{"title":"We can\'t afford job security","permalink":"/blog/we-cant-afford-job-security"}},"content":"I am surrounded by independent thinkers. [^1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: if you can\'t see what I did there, I\'m disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this limited sampling, I learn that most of these independent thinkers had an episode of being misunderstood, disagreed, or ridiculed by the people around them. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that society generally prefers conformity, those who stand out or question the status quo are generally meet resistance from social exclusion to hostility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also a common trope in anime, movies, videogames, pop content we consume -- where the protagonists are often portrayed as independent people who frequently invite opposition and antagonists. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe come to take for granted that this is just the way it is and think nothing about it. Perhaps its just a \\"main character syndrome\\", where everyone universally has the same experience of rejection, its just that only the survivors get to tell their story and the rest of us romanticize those misunderstandings and adversity. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis romanticization, while inspiring, obscures the fact that the experiences of independent people are not unique or extraordinary but rather a common consequence of their nonconformity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe there is a structural reason why anyone who attempts to be independent will meet opposition and social challenges, and is very uncommon for independent people to be ignored or celebrated. [^2] \\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: There are cases of autistic people who can do own thing competently and oblivious to the negativity or oppositions of others. While such ignorance means they are not held back by public opinion, it is still more probable their avant-garde work meets more resistance relative to support. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## A conformist can\'t be disagreed\\r\\n\\r\\nSimply because a conformist\'s reward function is to be agreed. If they ever get disagreed, they will just shift their ideas to what is conventionally accepted. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy sampling bias, it means deviants will experience 90% of all disagreements. [^5]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^5]: Inversely, it could mean any person who experienced a chronic disagreements are more likely to see themselves as a deviant -- this is fallacy thinking. Someone who is consistently disagreed may see themselves as a deviant, but that **doesn\'t mean they are not a conformist.** A conformist can keep saying the wrong thing, be disagreed by a diverse group of people, and they will wrongly imagine that they are a deviant and the rest are conformist.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deviant minds are easy targets\\r\\nA deviant often become easy targets for those seeking to enhance their social reputation. \\r\\n\\r\\nOpposing the establishment, especially in fields like politics is a braindead strategy to gain attention and support. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, political candidates may rise to power simply by positioning themselves as opponents of the existing order, without necessarily offering substantial or innovative policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The case of Tachibana Takeshi is a great illustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZG95grO-vc&ab_channel=Japanalysis). His political ascent was primarily fueled by his opposition to the NHK fee -- a stance that resonated with many who were dissatisfied with the status quo. However, once in power, it became evident that his strategy, politics, and philosophy lacked depth and he lost his momentum after \\"the dragon has been slain\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nThe point is \\"braindead opposition strategy\\" against any target that sticks out is very rewarding, and deviants unintentionally create opportunities for others to gain prominence by simply opposing them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe act of contradicting a deviant is low-risk / high-reward behavior, making deviants easy targets for those seeking to elevate their own social standing.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changing minds forces people to reflect on weaknesses\\r\\nActing as a messenger of truth or promoting independent ideas is high risk. It is much simpler and less risky for individuals to conform to the majority opinion than to challenge it. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen deviants change people\'s minds, they encounter resistance because their message forces others to confront their own vulnerabilities or mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can lead to defensive reactions, as individuals feel compelled to double down on their established positions to avoid appearing wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis dynamic is even more obvious in institutional settings, where admitting the validity of an deviant\'s ideas means rejecting the institution they are part of -- it is an equivalent of being placed in an \\"ideological death ground\\" if one has a career or is dependent on the survival of the institution. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases of a person being placed in \\"death grounds\\", the pushback is desperate, regardless of how right a deviant\'s ideas are. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, the pushback is directed to the deviant itself, regardless of how much this antagonism is justified. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## It is inevitable for deviants to invite trouble\\r\\nSo long as we have a social dynamic that rewards reputation and conformity, status consciousness becomes an investment with ROI. Then, being a deviant inherently invites trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not that any individual personal have an issue against deviants -- most individuals would prefer interacting with a deviant over conformists. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the social system finds it easy to penalize deviants because status consciousness means some agent find their ranking and rewards threatened by uncommon behaviors. [^4] \\r\\n\\r\\n[^4]: In cases of a group of people who don\'t compare with one another, you notice that independent behaviors don\'t meet as much rejections as these groups have no status games to play with one another. Since neither cares much about their own reputation, another person\'s action doesn\'t bring them any threat and you observe less \\"witch-hunting\\" behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe act of questioning norms or presenting alternative viewpoints disrupts the equilibrium and can threaten the reputation of those invested in maintaining the status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll argue that due to this dynamic, **it is impossible for anyone to have true independent thinking unless they have complete detachment from status consciousness.** [^3] [^6] [^7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: A simple observation is to observe artists and their behavior pre-fame and post-fame. An artist is an embodiment of independence. But anyone who observes an artist that rises to fame is that they become less controversial the more popular they are. If my theory is true, artists who gets less controversial become like that because they have more interest in developing status consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[^6]: I expect pushback for saying this, but I think this reason also explains why creative women are less common than creative men. Women are more status conscious, so there is a disadvantage in the capacity to hold independent thoughts. That is not to say women are less creative -- a woman who is detached from status conscious are just as capable of being creative. Inversely, a man that is burdened by status-conscious will have as much trouble being creative.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[^7]: This theory also support the observation that many great art in ancient history was done by non-hetero people (Michelangelo, Nikola Tesla). But as LGBTQ and DEI gathers more social momentum and subsequently more conformist, you see a decline in the quality of art produced by non-hetero people if they happen to be absorbed by the conformist movement (Snow White and Concord are the latest disasters).\\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## TLDR\\r\\n\\r\\nDeviants invite troubles because challenging the status quo disrupts social dynamics and threatens the reputation of those who benefit from the existing order. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe obstacles faced by deviants are not always personal and its more likely rooted in human nature and the structures of society. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile independence is crucial for innovation and progress, it comes at a cost that not everyone is willing or able to bear. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo all deviants: Don\'t be a drama queen and think everyone is out there to get you. Everyone is \\"out there to get you\\" because that is what people do.

Because most people\'s idea of \\"job security\\" requires them to be a high paying white-collar bureaucrat in an office with a big corner desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nWho wants to have a secure job that needs you to deal with dirt, danger, difficulties? If you can handle those 3Ds I guarantee your career is secure 100%. Incidentally, those are the jobs people look forward the most to be replaced. \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the reality is not that there is \\"no job security\\", rather it is \\"there is not enough non-3D secure jobs\\" in this world, because each one requires a government or bureaucracy to print or devalue existing currency to keep you and your desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen everyone thinks they are entitled to that illusion, what do you think is going to happen to future generations? \\r\\n\\r\\nSome people worked hard to get a cushy, secure job as a C-level in some corporate, public office, conglomerate, consultancy, education institution. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn average person will think the price is decades of hard work climbing the career ladder and dealing with occasional office politics -- it is not the only price paid. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the job is an administrative role where the \\"ascension\\" requires building a wall to keep off competitors (EG: adding regulations, raising licensing requirements to limit labor supply), paper pushing (office equivalent of digging a hole then filling a hole), it may be complicit in making some of the younger generations less free in doing productive work and less free with their social mobility. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever felt \\"credential inflation\\" and lower conversion rates in job application rates, this is what\'s happening and you have the market that existed before you to thank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are still young and starting out in your career, stop buying the idea or complaining about job security -- it was never there. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf it was, then the (money printing and deficit spending) ship has sailed and you need to start making something for yourself. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook up your state\'s public spending, learn how to read financial statements of companies, and learn how money and value is created.

When I was an amateur, I thought the requirement to be a good composer is complexity, difficulty, and novelty, yet I notice a lot of great composers can get away with composition that is simple to play (C-major), cliched progressions (4/4 time signature) (1-4-5-6 progression) and still hitting the top charts. \\r\\n\\r\\nInversely, a composition that is played by all parts of the orchestra constantly with complex maneuver are actually works done by an amateur. With the advent of digital music, it is now possible for composers to write in range and complexity that are impossible to perform. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\nIf difficulty and activity are signs of skill, then music topping the charts would have been electronic music with 10 instruments playing throughout the song at 200 BPM, with SFX automation clips stacked over one another.

It is shameful to be seen by your friends that you don\'t have a full schedule one month ahead of you. You look like a loser if you don\'t have anything going on during your weekends or holidays. \\r\\n\\r\\nAsk any artist, software developer, writer that is competent, and they always seem to arrive to the same answer-- effective emptiness, blanks, and space is required in a finished good product. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think management and hustlers have a lot to learn from these people."},{"id":"ineffective-leaders","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ineffective-leaders","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2024/10-10-ineffective-leaders.md","source":"@site/blog/2024/10-10-ineffective-leaders.md","title":"Anatomy of Ineffective leaders","description":"Over 10 years of being someone\'s worker, leaders that own those characters demonstrate worse track records in company performance than leaders that don\'t have those characteristics.","date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"management","permalink":"/blog/tags/management"},{"inline":true,"label":"business","permalink":"/blog/tags/business"}],"readingTime":2.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ineffective-leaders","title":"Anatomy of Ineffective leaders","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["management","business"]},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740161000000,"prevItem":{"title":"Less is more","permalink":"/blog/less-is-more"},"nextItem":{"title":"Test MDX","permalink":"/blog/test-mdx"}},"content":"Over 10 years of being someone\'s worker, leaders that own those characters demonstrate worse track records in company performance than leaders that don\'t have those characteristics. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Speculating on stocks or futures\\r\\n\\r\\nA leader should spend all their time creating and engineering a better future. Speculating on markets outside their expertise should be a waste of time if they really know what they are doing. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nEven lower confidence if I peeked at their portfolio and notice them losing trades on speculative assets. Is that the reason why my boss urgently needs money and productivity? \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some exceptions, where a great investor is also doing the hands-on work of running a company. [^1]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: In rare cases, I met leaders who are great investors and they are great people to work with as they understand macro, accounting, and good business models. I hold suspicion to leaders who are responsible for a large part of the company and its workers future, but somehow find time for short-term derivatives and engage with trading systems they cannot explain. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Threatens misbehaving employees with pay cut and termination \\r\\n\\r\\nIf an employee is a problem and you can do without them, terminate. Don\'t need to threaten. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you must threaten, intimidation is a poor strategy to motivate someone who is underperforming or misbehaving -- a leader that makes a poor strategy is a poor leader. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens when you threaten is resentment and people preparing to jump ship as soon as they find the opportunity. Bad retention strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nRoll for persuasion, not intimidation.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Not respectful of other people\'s time\\r\\n\\r\\nBy showing up late, or keeping people overtime on projects or meetings. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, this behavior is confounded with regular poor business judgment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey tend to have budget issues and lack of manpower issues, but I hypothesize the true cause is that they cannot properly allocate priorities. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Underpays or too much cost-cutting \\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\'t build a sports team that wins by buying players at wholesale prices. Lots of people do it, but I haven\'t seen one that works. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone really had a good solution to your problem, you pay as much as you can to get it. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnderpaying and cost-cutting is also a behavior that\'s confounded with priority issues similar to (3). \\r\\n\\r\\nUnderpaying, while it works against workers who are desperate enough to put up with those conditions, also has the effect of hiding the real costs of the problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nLeaders will take for granted that this is all the investment that needs to get things done (at unsustainable prices) and think they have margins to pursue even worse market ideas. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\'t win from someone\'s losses by lowballing. You also lose out on real information that would have stopped you from pursuing bad ideas."},{"id":"/test-mdx","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/test-mdx","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2019/02-02-test-mdx.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2019/02-02-test-mdx.mdx","title":"Test MDX","description":"// Render a YouTube video player","date":"2019-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"maintenance","permalink":"/blog/tags/maintenance"}],"readingTime":0.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Test MDX","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["maintenance"],"slug":"/test-mdx"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740161000000,"prevItem":{"title":"Anatomy of Ineffective leaders","permalink":"/blog/ineffective-leaders"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Blog Post","permalink":"/blog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"import React from \'react\';\\r\\nimport ReactPlayer from \'react-player\';\\r\\n\\r\\n// Render a YouTube video player\\r\\n<ReactPlayer\\r\\n  url=\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6aATShbHeo&ab_channel=NEL-V\'\\r\\n  controls\\r\\n  width=\'100%\'\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"},{"id":"first-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2019/01-01-first-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019/01-01-first-post.md","title":"First Blog Post","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...","date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"bruh","permalink":"/blog/tags/bruh"}],"readingTime":0.135,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"first-blog-post","title":"First Blog Post","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["bruh"]},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740161000000,"prevItem":{"title":"Test MDX","permalink":"/blog/test-mdx"}},"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n...consectetur adipiscing elit.
