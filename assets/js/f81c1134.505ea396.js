But it\'s also plagued by problems similar to the past.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing wealth gaps, squeezed middle class, low birth rates, public debts that are increasing unsustainable, difficult job market.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainstream narrative now is that the rich have been exploiting the poor, and that all of the problems will go away if only we tax them enough or regulate their profits such that it is no longer predatory. Or, it\'s a specific race or cabal that is controlling the strings.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with such reasoning is that the antagonist is too obvious. Too many people talk about them, and in fact most of the time people from the past fell for the same narrative. When revolutions end up happening, it wasn\'t clear if the rich was actually the problem.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the French Revolution, it\'s not about the 99% against the 1% as we so commonly believed. It\'s more like the [top 1% against the top 0.1%](https://x.com/GaletteSaw6/status/1892255392987582924/photo/1). Most of the common people don\'t even get represented while they get taken into the violent ride.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPut simply, associating wealth with crime is fallacious. The reason why this narrative gets momentum is because it appeals to the envious. I argue it\'s in the interest of people who are actually doing the stealing to misdirect public attention away from them to people with big numbers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHow then should one find the dishonest actor that explains all of the present problems and injustice without resorting to sloppy reasoning that matches what the mainstream wants you to antagonize?   \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Discovering the anatomy of the heist  \\r\\n\\r\\nMost understand that problems and inefficiency don\'t come out of nowhere, therefore something/someone must be responsible. The next thing to be aware would be if the observed inefficiency is **deliberate** or **accidental**.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMany things that contribute to the growing wealth gap are participated by market players accidentally.  \\r\\n\\r\\nExample, the growth in job complexity and bureaucracy accidentally created wealth gap between those who have exposed themselves to enough cultural capital (through tertiary education) to perform bureaucratic tasks while leaving behind those who cannot afford [tertiary education to gain the cultural capital](https://wcer.wisc.edu/docs/working-papers/Working_Paper_No_2017_2.pdf) required to stay compliant to current regulations and complexity demand.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look at things objectively, you may understand that dumb regulations and dumb degrees / license to bypass these regulations are the **root of problem as to how some people unjustly got ahead / left behind**. Yet, you hardly hear the mainstream complaining about this problem.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, getting a degree, expecting stricter regulations, and going through very selective labor vetting process has become a cultural dogma that few even draw the connection that this is a possible vector for social division.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a related topic, the other day I had an argument with my sister about the effectiveness of state education, the most extreme case being China\'s Gaokao -- The same system that is the [most unfair and repressive to lower class](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/22125868211035802?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.192) also happened to [get the most support and defense from the lower class](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/comment/k42ydza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  \\r\\n\\r\\nGaokao creates \\"unequal\\" outcomes and \\"widening social class,\\" in the sense that it forces the lower class youth to live and think that their life is a predictable grind (IE: another form of serfdom). But to many families, having a child that performs well in state exams is their only lotto to have their social status raised. Their defense to such a system is another example of people \\"accidentally\\" creating social division.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, the gaokao system seems to be fall under the a category I would classify as \\"opportunity stealing hero\\" (OSH).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are convinced that China\'s gaokao creates net inequality (not through measurements of wealth, but through psychology where competitive students lose their independence of thought to conform to the grind culture), then you\'ll also find that most state\'s public education don\'t do better.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[In US, public schools spend $20k per student](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics) for the results of [20% illiteracy rate](https://www.thenationalliteracyinstitute.com/post/literacy-statistics-2024-2025-where-we-are-now). Acquiring information on YouTube, skillshare will not cost a curious individual more than $500/yr.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the objective of public education is to increase public literacy and standardized knowledge to promote cultural equality, the results have been opposite -- education administrators are overpaid while young students get dumber and taxpayers get even more broke.  \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, public educators continue to enjoy powerful political advantages, social returns, and positive public opinion. Another example of OSH.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith 3 examples, we can begin to find the anatomy of the heist by observing the commonalities.  \\r\\n\\r\\n- **Must have a way to avoid competition**, either through political protection (state education) or high barriers to entry (creating more regulations, requiring higher ranking licenses), etc.  \\r\\n- **Decisions are undemocratic** (regulations setup by \\"think tanks\\" and \\"experts\\")  \\r\\n- [**Victims having \\"Stockholm syndrome\\"** to net negative practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/17334c1/whats_the_deal_with_chinas_gao_kao/). (The hero convinces the victims who had been taken advantage that they in fact benefit from the transaction)  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith such leads, finding out who else fit such a bill is more productive than being told who is the antagonist.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enjoy where your logic will take you, stop scrolling and start thinking and see if your answers match with mine later.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will do the honors and take the risk of exposing institutions with questionable motive and outcomes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHere goes.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Heist Showdown  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Central banks  \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Uncompetitive\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral banks serve as the lender of last resort -- a function that allows them to provide emergency liquidity to banks, thereby forestalling systemic collapse. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one else gets this right to create value out of nothing. While it\'s hard to say they are dishonest, there is no way we can know how accountable too. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a competitive market, an unaccountable bank would face consequences for poor policies. In central bank\'s case, mostly its just \\"bad luck\\", \\"bad timing\\", \\"oops\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nFor CB with weaker political power, it is possible for market players to force a competitive decision. (EG: [George Soros breaking the BoE by betting against their bad policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/altvbm/the_man_who_broke_the_bank_of_england/))\\r\\n\\r\\nFor stronger CB, especially the US Federal Reserve,\\r\\n[it took decades for people to realize and agree some disastrous results done by central banks.](https://www.econlib.org/yes-monetary-policy-did-cause-the-great-depression/) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Undemocratic  \\r\\n\\r\\n[The public cannot elect a Fed Chair; the selection process is conducted behind closed doors with little transparency](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12591.htm) -- comparable in its secrecy to the election of a pope. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fed Chair can make policies that influence credit markets such that it directly kills business or raise portfolio value.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n[The 2% inflation target is a dogma, not an expert research or public agreement.](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2023/09/04/why-the-2-inflation-target/) I can read the whole link to you. Or I can just tell you it\'s all vibes. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Enough victims with Stockholm.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMany are \u201cvictimized\u201d by policies done by CB. If you own cash, the real value of their money is eroded by inflation. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, most can\'t reject this poison, especially if you are an office workers with state contracts (where do you think the state gets their money to pay your contract work?), are a homeowners whose asset values grow together with each successive rounds of money printing. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you work in office, your employment is likely an illusion. They will still raise back enough taxes from you to make back the money they printed to pay you [^1]. If you have any more left to spend, they will devalue it by printing the next round of money.  \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Interestingly, [federal income taxes we paid for granted started when the CB was invented at 1913](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/history-taxes.asp).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe become unwitting \u201cStockholmers\u201d by growing psychologically dependent on a system that also steals from us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Human resources and recruiting industry  \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Anticompetitive\\r\\nHave you met a department that is in charge of firing and hiring HR?  \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Undemocratic\\r\\nHR and recruitment comes up with lots of policies that have consequential effects to the market, yet they are not subjected to the agreement of their customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, HR policies routinely use expensive educational degrees as prerequisites for roles -- even when the actual performance gap between degree holders and non-degree holders is negligible in many real-world contexts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, HR legitimizes the value of expensive educational degrees simply by using it as a prerequisite to the roles they have. This isn\'t problematic if educational degrees do actually have value as a competency signal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find out if degrees, licenses, or other credentials are actually a competency signal, a scientific method would be to look at the data by systematically measuring the quality of both recruits and rejects using an objective function.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have hardly met any HR that does this [^2].\\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: I\'ve spoke around recruiters during informal settings. In most of my conversations with recruiters, the best indicator of a good candidate is \\"what other recruiters\\" say about them. In logical settings, this is known as \\"circular reasoning\\". It\'s as unscientific as \\"just vibes\\". Yeah, you think people who make important decisions are more responsibile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\'t help that degree standards are getting lower while jobs are getting more complex. These days, the performance gap of degree owners and non-degree owners are negligible in the real world. \\r\\n\\r\\nDegrees now function more like a \\"ticket you buy for the chance to work\\" that [gatekeeps labor supply to include only those who can afford a 4 year hiatus and 100k expense.](https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/pierre-bourdieu-cultural-capital-in-the-21st-century/)  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHR could easily fix their poor policy by simply letting themselves subjected to a scientific method, where they measure the quality of their recruits and the lack of quality of their rejects. [I\'ve suggested a simple way to do it.](/blog/2025-01-03-how-to-test-recruiting.md)\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, there is simply no market, competitive, moral pressure to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Victims with Stockholm\\r\\nBusiness owners, shareholders, and job seekers think we are better off with them. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat people don\'t ask is how many of the problems the HR / recruitment industry solves are problems created by a bureacracy (that recruiters could be part of). \\r\\n\\r\\nExample: employment rights, unions, protection of workers supposedly protect workers from unfair labor practices (Stockholm warning). But this also make it much harder for business owners to hire and fire employees, thus justifying the need for HR / recruiters. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2nd order effect is that business are less willing to hire and invest in employees, given that underperforming employees are so hard to let go. \\r\\n\\r\\nI can\'t make the call that we are better off without labor regulations. But its important to understand the more complex we make labor laws, the more power HR and recruiters get. At some point, job seekers lose and business owners lose.\\r\\n\\r\\n---  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Is it a \\"middleman problem\\"? \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe most of the bad things in life are not intentional. It\'s very rare to meet someone with a mission of causing as much damage as they can while getting away with it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis means its important to inspect for systems that are supposedly \\"good\\" but at some point stop serving the interest of the system consumer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I notice is that problems that are so complicated to need a middleman tends to attract \\"careerist\\"[^3] to setup uncompetitive bureaucracy (IE: rent-seeking toll).\\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: Career usually mean something better than job and supposedly requires more respect. But rent-seeking can also be a career. The question is should the public sponsor such careers? \\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"But aren\'t the rich the real final boss?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s too convenient, too big of the brush, and often results in bad policies. Instead, I think it\'s more helpful to expose people to the anatomy of how institutions can take advantage of the public. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as the public are uncritical about their practices, the bureacracy can keep masquerading as a value-creator when its a parasite [^4]. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^4]: Parasite is a strong word, but the classification is that it must grow infinitely at the expense of the host\'s strength. This is consistent with my observations. The Fed gets stronger everytime they print more money and do not hesitate to increase their personnel. Similarly, HR went from 0.5% workforce to 1.5% workforce from 1980 to 2020. In the same time with the growth of these institutions, their \\"customers\\" get weaker. This is unlike competitive economic systems (example Nvidia) where their growth is also followed by the growth in strength by their customers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"real-function-of-taxes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/real-function-of-taxes","editUrl":"https://github.com/neldivad/neldivad.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-02-10-taxes-are-dumb.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-10-taxes-are-dumb.md","title":"The real function of taxes","description":"Taxes are dumb.","date":"2025-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"economics","permalink":"/blog/tags/economics"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"}],"readingTime":6.955,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Len","title":"Software Developer","url":"https://github.com/neldivad","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/neldivad"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/divadlenMusic","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@justneldivad","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/divadlen/","github":"https://github.com/neldivad"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/neldivad.png","key":"neldivad"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"real-function-of-taxes","title":"The real function of taxes","authors":["neldivad"],"tags":["economics","finance"]},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1740095876000,"prevItem":{"title":"How to steal from the public without public attention","permalink":"/blog/how-to-steal-from-the-public"},"nextItem":{"title":"We can\'t afford job security","permalink":"/blog/we-cant-afford-job-security"}},"content":"Taxes are dumb. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s hard to be controversial to say so. Most people who worked and earned money for a living would be frustrated by the whole experience that is so embedded in modern society, to the point it becomes something we learned to be helpless about. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThis post won\'t try to change the way taxes work. I\'m too small of a player for the legal system to give a damn about. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, I can explain how taxes work in a way that the common person will learn, and people can decide if taxes are worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Modern monetary theory\\r\\n\\r\\nModern money is all fiat, meaning it is not backed by anything. Not gold, not oil, just blind trust. Actually, it is backed by the power of military[^1], but we will leave the story to another day. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: Modern fiat currencies aren\'t entirely worthless. Typically currency is legitimized through public confidence. A currency that can be printed endlessly would mean more people opting out of the network. But confidence is fragile and fluctuates, so a mandate and force is more reliable. You will notice that reserve currencies tend to be controlled by contries with the strongest military. It is no coincidence. Having a gun means you accept whatever value there is on the paper. This is also a short story why I think cryptocurrencies are unviable. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are to accept that money is not backed by anything, a state theoretically doesn\'t need to collect taxes before they spend -- they can just spend on what they want and pay it back later by raising taxes, or to do nothing and devalue all cash and savings. \\r\\n\\r\\n### \\"Why bother collecting taxes?\\"\\r\\nGreat question. The amount of effort it takes to collect taxes is enormous. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the US as an example (its the most available one to build my priors) [the estimates of tax compliance cost of the $546 billion, or nearly 2 percent of GDP.](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/irs-tax-compliance-costs/) \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnually, the US government raises [17% of GDP as taxes](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFRGDA188S). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, we are spending $25 for every $100 we harass a productive business to give the state. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis number includes taxes paid through active means (IRS audits) and passive means (taxes on income, VAT). If we are to estimate the cost of active collection and the actual tax revenue active collectors raised, it may be less than the cost it takes to finance active collectors. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s like spending $100 on debt collectors (debt isn\'t even a right word as it implies we owe the state our production) to raise something less than $100. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the objective of taxes is really to raise capital to afford projects, active collection seems ineffective at what they do. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of answering why are we doing something inefficient, let\'s start with what happens if we just do nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 1: Really doing nothing\\r\\n\\r\\nNo government spending, no taxes, constant supply of money. The state is literally sleeping at the wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnrealistic scenario, but suppose this happens we should predict inflation to be 0%. This seems like a time when we have a perfect currency. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is that the economy becomes perfectly competitive, which means those that earn will hold more currency and control a bigger share of the network (mercantilism). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe currency becomes less representative to those who are weaker or less competitive. With no state spending, there is no safety net except for private charities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf people expect spending will cause them to lose power to sellers, then transactions are seen as zero-sum and the economy gets more illiquid. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 2: Doing anything the state wants\\r\\n\\r\\nState prints as much money as it wants, gives out as much to anyone who will vote for them. Never collects any of them back. \\r\\n\\r\\nSounds too good to be true. Now people stop producing because there is no reason to. When there is no production, all the money can\'t buy anything -- you have a hyperinflation situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s more! When people expect the currency to get weaker, the network of producers becomes more reluctant to accept the currency -- people rather do a barter trade or keep good things for themselves than to take your currency.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Case 3: Spend now, collect back everything later\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"perfect\\" scenario. The state spends as much as it wants to get something done, then get back all the money it spent back from people through taxes. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo net inflation, and stuff gets done! What\'s the problem? \\r\\n\\r\\n#### There is always a better deal \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a more perfect scenario -- stuff gets done, and people keep all the newly minted currency. If something valuable was already done, why waste energy to give back the catalyst (ie: the currency)?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem happens when the currency gets spent on more things than it was made to spend on (IE: buying labor for social services becomes salary to spend and compete on limited goods) -- Taxes ensures the velocity of created money is not infinite. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice people can always argue why they don\'t need to return the currency, so its hard to take back as much money as we created. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Whose stuff gets done? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe state can create money to buy for things they want, but in practice you can bet the decisions aren\'t fair (IE: what the state wants to buy might not be what the people want to buy).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the state can just set up a shell company with their entourage, print some money and pay his friends and declaring his friends are being \\"paid to do social work\\". -- This is wastage in a nutshell. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, things are not so blatant. Its more likely for state actors to set up lots of layers of agency that takes some cut of the budget, where the agency also happens to contain a share of the state\'s entourage -- also known as \\"deep state\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nSo a scenario with perfect balance sheet is not perfect if the work paid to do / things bought isn\'t representative. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Crowding out\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the state prints money to hire workers, then it means someone else would lose the worker they wanted to hire to do their work. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a free market, the most important work gets done first and that is reflected by prices and bids. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the state spends money, it is unclear if the work that needs to be done are the most important ones. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen suboptimal decisions are made and financed, in effect that is also a net loss to the people. It\'s like saying you win 10% doing something when you could have won 50% doing nothing -- a good outcome is not a valid defense for a good decision. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## It\'s all decisions\\r\\nNotice the theme here. The state can do anything it wants, but its decisions must be sound (IE: logical, benefits the people, within budget). \\r\\n\\r\\nA sound decision is one that is profitable. IE: You spend little to do a lot. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the state does something suboptimal, the net effect is the people\'s standard of living will devalue because they: \\r\\n1. need to ask more taxes from the people to pay back what they spent.\\r\\n2. print more money to pay back what they spent, creating inflation. \\r\\n\\r\\n**In modern finance, taxes are paid so inflation does not happen.**\\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\n## \\"Why not just let inflation happen?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat question. If the net effect of ineffective state spending is lower standards of living, and the way it is delivered can be either passive (through inflation) or active (through taxes), we could choose to do nothing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy go through all the hassle and trouble to feel pain? \\r\\n\\r\\nI could write a whole post on how money works, how it flows. But the short answer I discovered after 20 years of studying money is: \\"it\'s all politics\\". \\r\\n\\r\\n> You will never understand bureaucracies until you understand that for bureaucrats procedure is everything and outcomes are nothing. -- Thomas Sowell\\r\\n\\r\\nActually... [^2] [^3]\\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: Unlike inflation that erodes power indiscrimately, taxes are are more targeted to specific people. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: There is a perspective where taxes make sense, like a \\"subscription\\" to the government.

Because most people\'s idea of \\"job security\\" requires them to be a high paying white-collar bureaucrat in an office with a big corner desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nWho wants to have a secure job that needs you to deal with dirt, danger, difficulties? If you can handle those 3Ds I guarantee your career is secure 100%. Incidentally, those are the jobs people look forward the most to be replaced. \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the reality is not that there is \\"no job security\\", rather it is \\"there is not enough non-3D secure jobs\\" in this world, because each one requires a government or bureaucracy to print or devalue existing currency to keep you and your desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen everyone thinks they are entitled to that illusion, what do you think is going to happen to future generations? \\r\\n\\r\\nSome people worked hard to get a cushy, secure job as a C-level in some corporate, public office, conglomerate, consultancy, education institution. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn average person will think the price is decades of hard work climbing the career ladder and dealing with occasional office politics -- it is not the only price paid. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the job is an administrative role where the \\"ascension\\" requires building a wall to keep off competitors (EG: adding regulations, raising licensing requirements to limit labor supply), paper pushing (office equivalent of digging a hole then filling a hole), it may be complicit in making some of the younger generations less free in doing productive work and less free with their social mobility. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever felt \\"credential inflation\\" and lower conversion rates in job application rates, this is what\'s happening and you have the market that existed before you to thank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are still young and starting out in your career, stop buying the idea or complaining about job security -- it was never there. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf it was, then the (money printing and deficit spending) ship has sailed and you need to start making something for yourself. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook up your state\'s public spending, learn how to read financial statements of companies, and learn how money and value is created. You will quickly come to conclusion the only way wealth can be created is to do something that helps people and do it better (IE: getting better at your craft). \\r\\n\\r\\nMost office jobs today are \\"state manufactured elites\\". IE: the state lends money for someone to get into college, get in debt, then offers them to be a slave for the state. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is as ridiculous as minting your own crypto, selling \\"scholarships\\" to players by borrowing them your axoloties, and sending those axolotl to battle as a chore.

When I was an amateur, I thought the requirement to be a good composer is complexity, difficulty, and novelty, yet I notice a lot of great composers can get away with composition that is simple to play (C-major), cliched progressions (4/4 time signature) (1-4-5-6 progression) and still hitting the top charts. \\r\\n\\r\\nInversely, a composition that is played by all parts of the orchestra constantly with complex maneuver are actually works done by an amateur. With the advent of digital music, it is now possible for composers to write in range and complexity that are impossible to perform. \\r\\n\\r\\n--- \\r\\n\\r\\nIf difficulty and activity are signs of skill, then music topping the charts would have been electronic music with 10 instruments playing throughout the song at 200 BPM, with SFX automation clips stacked over one another.
